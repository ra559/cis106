* [**VS Code:**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

## Requirements
* Access to a computer where Linux can be installed. The following are options:
  * A virtual machine (Preferred)
  * A spare laptop/Desktop computer that you can formatted. For example:
    * A mini PC
    * An old PC
* Access to Blackboard
* A Github account
* A Text editor. We will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can use other text editors  but if you run into problems, I cannot provide help.
* 2 Hours of study time - <b style="color:red;">MANDATORY</b>
* Capable of adjusting to fast paced course
* **For virtualization**
  * A decent PC that meets or exceeds these requirements:
    * Quad-Core Processor
    * 8 Gb of RAM
    * Windows 10/11
    * 100 Gb of free space
* **Knowledge of the following**
  * Basic components of a personal computer
    * Basic usage of a personal computer
    * Internet browsing
    * Reading emails
    * Chat Applications
    * Office Productivity Suites (MS Office, Google Docs, etc)
    * Install/Remove Software
    * Difference between web browser, the internet, and a search engine
> Not knowing this things does not mean you will fail the course. It means that you will have to spend extra time studying.

## MacOS Users Read this:
* If you have a rencent MacOS Computer ( Apple M series of CPUs), you can use it for the class. The setup is different but I can guide you. 
* If you are using a MacOS Computer with an Intel CPU, make sure that it meets the same requirement as for windows.
 
## Advice
* If you find that the content of the course is too much or that you have too many gaps in your knowledge, I suggest that you take CIS-107 then CIS 180 or CIS 116. 
* If you do not have a decent computer (one that can be used for virtualization) you will have a very poor experience in this course. Contact me to discuss your options.
