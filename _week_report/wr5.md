## Complete the following tasks
### 1. Notes 5
Notes 5 must include
1. The following commands:
   1. `mkdir`
   2. `touch`
   3. `rm`
   4. `rmdir`
   5. `mv`
   6. `cp`

For every command include the following:
* Usage, formula, and examples (at least 3)

Please use this article [here](https://cis106.com/extra/thelinuxfs/) as and example of what proper markdown usage looks like. You should use: inline code formatting, headings, etc. Here is an illustrated example using ls.

> ***I will take points off for improper formatting***<br>
> Please! make sure to document good examples. All of these commands (except rmdir) will be used in your final exam. Remember, you can use your notes in your final exam therefore having proper examples with good explanations will help you tremendously


### 2. Week report 5
* Complete all the practice in the managing files and directories presentation. Take a screenshot of your terminal showing most if not all of the commands used in each practice. Make sure to label each screenshot using heading 2 or 3 (just like week report 4)

### 3. Complete lab 5

* Video [here](https://youtu.be/u0O72FLxeVc)

### 4. Start working on your final project deliverable 1 or deliverable 2 if you finished deliverable 1
* Starting this week, you should dedicate at least 20 minutes per week to your final project. The project is lengthy and I do not recommend waiting for the last minute because something always go wrong. 

### 5. Complete 1 of the discussion boards
* You should do at least 1 reply per week until you have completed the discussion boards. Normally, 10 minutes per week will allow you to finish them on time. 

### What will you submit:
It should be obvious by now but just in case:
1. Convert `wr5.md` to pdf
2. Push everything to github:
3. In blackboard submit:
   1. URL to `wr5.md` in GitHub
   2. The pdf file `wr5.pdf`	


### Special Note
You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference:
* `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer
* `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code
* `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. 
* `git commit -m "label for your changes here"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command
* `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository

> Always run the commands in this order: `pull` =>  `add` =>  `commit` => `push` 
> **Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository!**
