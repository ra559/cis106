> Your markdown file should be properly formatted. Use inline code formatting, code blocks, bold, etc ...
> ***I will take points off for improper formatting***

Please do not use images for command examples. I will take points off for that. You can include text and a supporting screenshot.

Use the article [here](https://cis106.com/extra/thelinuxfs/) as an example of what proper markdown usage looks like. You should use: inline code formatting, headings, etc. Here is an illustrated example using ls.
