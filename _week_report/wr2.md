# {{page.title}}

## Complete the following tasks
1. Complete [lab 2 - Installing Ubuntu 22.04](https://cis106.com/labs/lab2/).
2. If you have not done so, complete week report 1, lab 1 and Discussion Board 1
3. Complete Discussion Board 2 - The history of Linux
4. Complete this week report. This and everything else from this point on must be completed inside Ubuntu. Windows/MacOS will no longer be used.


## What will you submit:
> Note: 
> Since you already completed lab2, the remaining of the work in this course will be completed inside the Ubuntu virtual machine. Windows/MacOS will not be used for the remaining of the course!!! PLEASE DO NOT EDIT OR UPLOAD FILES TO GITHUB VIA THE WEBSITE
> This report can only be completed after lab 2!

1. Create a folder inside the `weekReports` folder called `wr2`. You probably did this already during lab 2.
2. Open the `cis106` folder in VS Code
3. Inside the `wr2` folder, create a file called `wr2.md`
4. Answer the following questions. Use the video as a reference. For obvious reasons, I did not complete the whole document in the video, I simply showed you how to do it and format it correctly. All the information to answer the questions can be found in the Lecture 2 presentation [Introduction to Linux](https://rapurl.live/dbx) and [The basics of virtualization](https://rapurl.live/bt7)
