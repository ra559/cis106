1. Complete [lab 2 - Installing Ubuntu 24.04](https://cis106.com/labs/Lab2_new/).
2. If you have not done so, complete week report 1, lab 1 and Discussion Board 1. *You cannot complete Lab 2 if you have not catched up!* 
3. Complete Discussion Board 2 - The history of Linux. **Note**: *you can do this later as the due date is the end of the semester.*
4. Complete Notes 2. This and everything else from this point on must be completed inside Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 (your virtual machine). Windows/MacOS will no longer be used. Therefore you MUST complete lab 2 before attempting the report and the notes.
5. Complete this week's Week Report. 


## What will you include in your notes?
Note: *folder* and *directory* mean the same thing! 
1. Create a folder inside your CIS106 folder called `notes`
2. Inside the `notes` directory/folder create a new folder called `notes1` and `notes2`
3. Move the files that are related to `notes1` to the `notes1` directory/folder.
4. Open the `cis106` directory/folder inside vs code.
5. Using vs code file manager, create a file inside the `notes2` directory called `notes2.md`
6. In the file `notes2.md`, answer the following questions. Make sure to use proper markdown syntax to make your notes file look presentable. Use headings, paragraphs and bullet point formatting. This, at a minimun, should make your file look presentable. **NO SCREENSHOTS!**  All the information to answer the questions can be found in the Lecture 2 presentation [Introduction to Linux](https://rapurl.live/dbx) and [The basics of virtualization](https://rapurl.live/bt7)

## What will you submit for your week report:
> Note: 
> Since you already completed lab2, the remaining of the work in this course will be completed inside the Ubuntu virtual machine. Windows/MacOS will not be used for the remaining of the course!!! PLEASE DO NOT EDIT OR UPLOAD FILES TO GITHUB VIA THE WEBSITE. You must use VS Code Terminal to commit and push to your repository. If you decide to ignore this. You are on your own. If you don't understand, please ask! 
> This report can only be completed after lab 2!

1. Create a folder inside the `weekReports` folder called `wr2`. You probably did this already during lab 2.
2. Open the `cis106` folder in VS Code
3. Inside the `wr2` folder, create a file called `wr2.md`
4. Add a link to your notes and lab2 markdown files in github.
5. Add a screenshot of your Ubuntu Desktop with a terminal open or firefox in the cis106.com website
6. Convert the `wr2.md` file to pdf
7. Push all the changes to github
8. In blackboard, submit the URL to the `wr2.md` file and the pdf file `wr2.pdf`

## Special Note 1
> Please take a snapshot of your virtual machine after you complete the report. The virtual machine is must be off before you take the snapshot. This process is show in the video

### Special Note 2
You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference:
* `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer
* `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code
* `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. 
* `git commit -m "label for your changes here"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command
* `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository

## Special Note:
* The final exam is in person. 
* The exam is performance based and will require access to a Linux Virtual Machine. 
* If you do not have a laptop/computer you can bring to school, a Linux Computer will be made available to you.
