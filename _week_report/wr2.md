[Week Report 2 Spring 24](https://youtu.be/f2EX7mVWzT4)

## Complete the following tasks
1. Complete [lab 2 - Installing Ubuntu 22.04](https://cis106.com/labs/lab2/).
2. If you have not done so, complete week report 1, lab 1 and Discussion Board 1
3. Complete Discussion Board 2 - The history of Linux
4. Complete this week report. This and everything else from this point on must be completed inside Ubuntu. Windows/MacOS will no longer be used.


## What will you submit:
> Note: 
> Since you already completed lab2, the remaining of the work in this course will be completed inside the Ubuntu virtual machine. Windows/MacOS will not be used for the remaining of the course!!! PLEASE DO NOT EDIT OR UPLOAD FILES TO GITHUB VIA THE WEBSITE
> This report can only be completed after lab 2!

1. Create a folder inside the `weekReports` folder called `wr2`. You probably did this already during lab 2.
2. Open the `cis106` folder in VS Code
3. Inside the `wr2` folder, create a file called `wr2.md`
4. Answer the following questions. Use the video as a reference. For obvious reasons, I did not complete the whole document in the video, I simply showed you how to do it and format it correctly. All the information to answer the questions can be found in the Lecture 2 presentation [Introduction to Linux](https://rapurl.live/dbx) and [The basics of virtualization](https://rapurl.live/bt7)

## Special Note 1
> Please take a snapshot of your virtual machine after you complete the report. The virtual machine is must be off before you take the snapshot. This process is show in the video

### Special Note 2
You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference:
* `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer
* `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code
* `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. 
* `git commit -m "label for your changes here"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command
* `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository
