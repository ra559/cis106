## Special Note 1
> Please take a snapshot of your virtual machine after you complete the report. The virtual machine is must be off before you take the snapshot. This process is show in the video
> You should have at least 2 snapshots of your vm. Keep in mind that snapshots take space.
> For Mac Users using UTM, snapshots are not supported therefore ignore this. Just keep your repository updated on github in case of a catastrophic failure.

### Special Note 2
You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference:
* `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer
* `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code
* `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. 
* `git commit -m "label for your changes here"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command
* `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository


## Special Note 3:
* The final exam is in person. 
* The exam is performance based and will require access to a Linux Virtual Machine. 
* If you do not have a laptop/computer you can bring to school, a Linux Computer will be made available to you.
