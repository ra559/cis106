### Special Note 2
You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference:
* `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer
* `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code
* `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. 
* `git commit -m "label for your changes here"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command
* `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository

> Always run the commands in this order: `pull` =>  `add` =>  `commit` => `push` 
> **Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository!**
