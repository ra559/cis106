## Complete the following tasks
### 1. Complete Discussion 3: The Rise of Open Source 
If you are short in time, leave this part for last
### 2. Complete week report. 
*Week Report must contain the following:*<br>

> If you need a refresher on the filesystem and the commands to navigate the filesystem, watch these videos. Otherwise, skip this part:
>  * [Navigating the filesystem Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNopWAAoVbM&list=PL5lh7Nw87hud1kA8FTE2UG3y9yvmON2s8&index=11)
>  * [Navigating the filesystem Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVX64H5D_k&list=PL5lh7Nw87hud1kA8FTE2UG3y9yvmON2s8&index=12)

1. Do all the practice exercises in the [presentation](https://bit.ly/3alPqPm). After completing each practice, take a screenshot of the terminal and put it in your weekly report. One screenshot per practice is enough to prove you did them.
2. Create a table that includes the following directories and their usage. All the information can be found in the [presentation](https://bit.ly/3alPqPm):
   1. bin
   2. dev
   3. etc
   4. home
   5.  media
   6.  opt
   7.  proc
   8.  srv
   9.  usr
   10. var
#### Example of how the table MUST look like:

| Directory | Data Stored in Directory                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| bin       | Nulla enim amet occaecat quis esse proident |

3. **Create a table of the commands used for navigating the file system. You have to use code formatting in your markdown just like the example. Your table must include the following:**
   * The command, 
   * what the command does, 
   * the syntax/formula of how to use the commands, 
   * an example of the command in  use.
> You can get all of that information from the [presentation.](https://rapurl.live/9b5)

#### Example of how the table MUST look like:

| Command | What it does                           | Syntax                                     | Example                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| echo    | Display text to the screen             | `echo` + `option` + `text to display`      | `echo -n "Hello World"` |
| apt     | Set of tools for managing deb packages | `sudo` + `apt` + `option` + `package name` | `sudo apt install vlc`  |
| uname   | prints system information              | `uname` + `option`                         | `uname -a`              |

4. **From The presentation, include the following:**
* The summary must include the following:
* Definitions of the following terms
   * File system
   * Current directory
   * parent directory
   * the difference between <b style="text-transform:uppercase;">your home</b> directory and <b style="text-transform:uppercase;">the home</b> directory
   * pathname
   * relative path
   * absolute path
   * A bulleted list of all the commands are used for navigating the filesystem.

### 4. Complete [lab 4: the linux fs](https://cis106.com/labs/lab4/). 
Please do these after you complete the Week report! Trust me, it is better this way.
