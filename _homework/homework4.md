# Homework 4
## Complete the following tasks
1. Complete Discussion board 5: What is The Right To Repair Movement? ***(If you are short in time, leave this part for last)***
2. If you need a refresher on the filesystem and the commands to navigate the filesystem, watch these videos. Otherwise, skip this part:
   * [Navigating the file system part 1](https://youtu.be/RNopWAAoVbM)
   * [Navigating the file system part 2](https://youtu.be/RxVX64H5D_k)
3. Complete week report. *Week Report must contain the following:*
   1. Do all the practice exercises in the [presentation](https://bit.ly/3alPqPm). After completing each practice, take a screenshot of the terminal and put in your weekly report.
   2. 5.Create a table that includes the following directories and their usage. All the information can be found in the [presentation](https://bit.ly/3alPqPm):
      1. bin
      2. dev
      3. etc
      4. home
      5.  media
      6.  opt
      7.  proc
      8.  srv
      9.  usr
      10. var
<br>
Your table must look like this:

| Directory | Data Stored in Directory                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| bin       | Nulla enim amet occaecat quis esse proident |


   3. Create a table of the commands used for navigating the file system (cd, pwd, ls). Your table must include the following:
      * The command, 
      * what the command does, 
      * the syntax/formula of how to use the commands, 
      * an example of the command in  use.
      > You can get all of that information from the [presentation.](https://rapurl.live/9b5)

### Here is an example of how your table should look like with commands you already used

| Command | What it does                           | Syntax                                     | Example                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| echo    | Display text to the screen             | `echo` + `option` + `text to display`      | `echo -n "Hello World"` |
| apt     | Set of tools for managing deb packages | `sudo` + `apt` + `option` + `package name` | `sudo apt install vlc`  |
| uname   | prints system information              | `uname` + `option`                         | `uname -a`              |
