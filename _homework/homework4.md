* [The Linux File System Presentation](https://rapurl.live/s39)
* [Ls Command Cheat Sheet](https://rapurl.live/kdy)
* [Absolute Path and Relative Path Cheat sheet](https://rebrand.ly/3bdn1)
* [Video here](https://youtu.be/CfuT4OQ4nbY)

## Complete the following tasks

### 1. Complete Week Report 4. Your report must contain the following:

1. Create a file inside the `weekReports` directory that is located inside the cis106 directory. Name this file, `wr4.md` or `weekReport4.md`
2. You will complete the week report inside the `wr4.md` file. Your report must contain 3 sections:
#### Practice from the presentation The Linux File system:
Complete all the Practice in the presentation **"The Linux File System"**. Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands, or most of the commands, you used to complete each practice. Place all your screenshots in your week report 4 file. Make sure to label each practice. See this video for an example or click on this link to see an example of the week report 4. 
#### The Linux File system directories and their purpose:
Take screenshots of the directories in the linux file system and their purpose. These can be found in the presentation: The Linux File system.
#### All the commands for navigating the filesystem 
Create a table of all the commands we use for navigating the file system (ls, cd, and pwd). You have to use code formatting in your markdown just like the example. Your table must include the following:
   * The command, 
   * what the command does, 
   * the syntax/formula of how to use the commands, 
   * an example of the command in  use.
> You can get all of that information from the presentation The Linux File system.

#### Example of how the table MUST look like:

| Command | What it does                           | Syntax                                     | Example                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| echo    | Display text to the screen             | `echo` + `option` + `text to display`      | `echo -n "Hello World"` |
| apt     | Set of tools for managing deb packages | `sudo` + `apt` + `option` + `package name` | `sudo apt install vlc`  |
| uname   | prints system information              | `uname` + `option`                         | `uname -a`              |

### Here is how the above example looks like in markdown for reference:

```
| Command | What it does                           | Syntax                                     | Example                 |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| echo    | Display text to the screen             | `echo` + `option` + `text to display`      | `echo -n "Hello World"` |
| apt     | Set of tools for managing deb packages | `sudo` + `apt` + `option` + `package name` | `sudo apt install vlc`  |
| uname   | prints system information              | `uname` + `option`                         | `uname -a`              |
```
### Basic terminology
Include definitions of the following terms
   * File system
   * Current directory
   * parent directory
   * the difference between <b style="text-transform:uppercase;">your home</b> directory and <b style="text-transform:uppercase;">the home</b> directory
   * pathname
   * relative path
   * absolute path

### 4. Complete [lab 4: the linux fs](https://cis106.com/labs/lab4/). 
Please do these after you complete the Week report! Trust me, it is better this way.
