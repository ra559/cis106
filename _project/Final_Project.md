At the end of the semester, the student will submit a document contain all of their work. This project consists of 4 deliverables that are designed to keep the student in track during the semester. The goal of the deliverable is to eliminate procrastination and simplify the way the student earns the grade. The final project constitutes 15% of the students final grade. This means that each deliverable is worth 5%.
