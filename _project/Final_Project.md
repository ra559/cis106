## Description
In this project, we are going to create a web server and host a simple website. We will follow a long a series of tutorials and we will document the process. At the end of the semester, the student will submit a document contain all of their work. This project consists of 4 deliverables that are designed to keep the student in track during the semester. The goal of the deliverable is to eliminate procrastination and simplify the way the student earns the grade. The final project constitutes 15% of the students final grade. This means that each deliverable is worth 5%.
## Requirements
* A virtual machine/PC where you can install Ubuntu Server. A Virtual machine will be preferred since everything in the tutorials will be done in a virtual machine.

This is the main tutorial we will follow:
* [How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-22-04)

Here are some sources you can use to investigate:
* [What is a Web Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)
* [What is SSH](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/Secure-Shell)
* [What is Ubuntu Server](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4207/ubuntu-server)
* [Open Source Web Servers](https://geekflare.com/open-source-web-servers/)

## Deliverable 1: Project's Requirements
For deliverable 1, we are going to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Read the tutorial. Write down every concept you don't understand and research them.
2. Answer The following questions:
* What is a web server? Hardware and software side
* What are some different web server applications?
* What is virtualization?
* What is virtualbox?
* What is a virtual machine?
* What is Ubuntu Server?
