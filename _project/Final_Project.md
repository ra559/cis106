## Description
In this project, we are going to create a web server and host a simple website. We will follow a long a series of tutorials and we will document the process. At the end of the semester, the student will submit a document contain all of their work. This project consists of 4 deliverables that are designed to keep the student in track during the semester. The goal of the deliverable is to eliminate procrastination and simplify the way the student earns the grade. The final project constitutes 15% of the students final grade. This means that each deliverable is worth 5%.
## Requirements
* A virtual machine/PC where you can install Ubuntu Server. A Virtual machine will be preferred since everything in the tutorials will be done in a virtual machine.

This is the main tutorial we will follow:
* [How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 22.04](https://rapurl.live/ch3)

Here are some sources you can use to investigate:
* [What is a Web Server](https://rapurl.live/pbe)
* [What is SSH](https://rapurl.live/9bg)
* [What is Ubuntu Server](https://rapurl.live/57a)
* [Open Source Web Servers](https://rapurl.live/pkm)

## Deliverable 1: Project's Requirements

> **Newer and shorter video is available [here](https://youtu.be/CYasEYqKq-s)**<br>
> **[Image resize tool](https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/upload)<br>
> **Example of how the deliverable should look like [here](https://rapurl.live/5d8)**
For **deliverable 1**, we are going to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Read the tutorial. Write down every concept you don't understand and research them.
2. Answer The following questions:
* What is a web server? Hardware and software side
* What are some different web server applications?
* What is virtualization?
* What is virtualbox?
* What is a virtual machine?
* What is Ubuntu Server?
* What is a firewall?
* What is SSH?

To demonstrate the completion of deliverable 1, the student needs to submit a markdown and pdf file where all the questions are answered. Here you can find an example of how the document should look like.


## Deliverable 2: Working with Ubuntu Server and Apache
> **Video playlist here[here](https://youtu.be/F0DdCC5Lq3A)**
> **Detail instructions with screenshots available [here](https://cis106.com/project/webserverProject/)
For deliverable 2, students will follow a playlist of youtube videos where we complete the following tasks:
1. Create a virtual machine for the server
2. Install Ubuntu Server
3. Install Apache2
4. Setup the firewall
5. Setup SSH to manage the server from the client virtual machine
6. Setup virtual hosts

Here you can find an example of how the document should look like.

> [Deliverable 2 example]()

As you can see, the student will submit a markdown file and pdf file along side the URL to deliverable 2. This file must contain screenshots and a brief description of each step completed.

## Deliverable 3: Hosting the site
> **Video [here](https://youtu.be/F0DdCC5Lq3A)**
For deliverable 3, students will write a simple html page. The student will do the following:
1. Create a simple markdown file about anything. The following are good examples:
2. The student will then convert the markdown file to HTML and will add bootstrap to the HTML.
3. The student will then upload the html page to the server.

Here you can find an example of how the document should look like.

> [Deliverable 3 example]()

As you can see, the student will submit a markdown file and pdf along side the url to deliverable 3. This file must contain a screenshot of the web browser open in the client virtual machine showing the website open. This is the only thing required for this deliverable. Adding a description is optional. 

## Deliverable 4: Final Deliverable
> **Video [here](https://youtu.be/F0DdCC5Lq3A)**
For deliverable 4, the student will compile all deliverables into a single document and add a table of contents. The file will be converted to pdf and the student will submit the markdown, pdf file, and the link to the final deliverable url in the students github account.

Here you can find an example of how the document should look like.

> [Deliverable 4 example]()

As you can see, the student will submit a markdown file and pdf along side the URL to deliverable 4. The file looks like a complete project with everything that has been done so far.
