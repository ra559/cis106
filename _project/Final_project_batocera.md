For deliverable 2, you will install Batocera in the Raspberry Pi and configure it. There are free games that you can download directly from Batocera. Those games are homebrews. ***Please do not include any Pirated Roms*** However, if you can find any free to play games that are legally available, you may use them.

After you have completed the installation and tested some games, create a markdown file that will answer the following questions:

1. **What are the steps to install Batocera in a Raspberry PI**
   1. Start by including a list of all the necessary hardware and why you need it. 
   2. Try to include as many screenshots as needed for every step
   3. Do not skip any step. Pretend that you are writing this guide for someone who is not very technical
2. **How to use Batocera?**
   1. How to start a game
   2. How to connect Batocera to the internet 
   3. How to update Batocera
   4. How to scrape a game? (Research what scrapping means)

## Deliverable 3

[Romhacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/?page=homebrew&category=1&platform=&source=&perpage=20&title=&search=Go) contains some homewbrews that you can download. You can also find roms in [myabandomware.com](https://www.myabandonware.com/) however I am uncertain of their legality therefore use at your own risk. This [site](https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml#snes) contains other homebrews a well.

Your goal for this final deliverable is to explain how to transfer games to your raspberry pi. There is more than one way to do so, for example, you can connect the sd card to your pc and copy the roms over their respective directory. You can also transfer the games over the web or over SSH connection. Your goal is to research each way of transferring games and document them here. 

After you have learn how to do it, create a markdown document explaining each way of transferring games and then providing step by step instructions. Do not include instructions on how to download roms. We are assuming that the reader of your guide already has roms that they legally own.
