### Tips:
* You will need to read the man page of the `echo`, `uname`, and `date` commands
* The date format in the screenshot is `RFC 5322`
* Save the script in the same directory/folder as you save the question 3 script `~/cis106/labs/lab3/`
* Name the script `challenge_lab3.sh`
* The command to run the script is `bash ~/cis106/labs/lab3/challenge_lab3.sh` if this does not work, it is because you saved the script in the wrong folder. Retrace your steps to troubleshoot. 
* You must complete this question alone. I cannot provide assistance here. Everything you need to complete this challenge has been covered in this lab.


## What will you submit:
1. place and properly label (using headings) all the screenshots you took. See the markdown I gave you at the beginning of this document
2. Convert the file to pdf
3. Push everything to github
4. In Blackboard, submit the pdf file `lab3.pdf`

**Note**: I will read your script from github. If the script is not there, you will not receive credit. 

## How I will grade you:
* I will navigate to your GitHub repository and read your script. I will download your script and run it on my machine. If your script runs and I get the same output as the screenshot, you will get full credit for the challenge question. Otherwise, partial credit will be awarded.
* Every question in this lab is worth 25 points.
