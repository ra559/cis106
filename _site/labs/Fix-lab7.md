## Question 1 | Tar Utility
1. In the `question1` directory, you will find a bunch of files. Create an archive called `allfiles.tar` that includes:
   1. All text files
   2. All images that have a number in their file names
   3. All video files

2. List all the members of the archive.
3. Create another text file with some text. Use the command `lorem` to generate the text and then output redirection to save it to a file. If the lorem command does not work, it means that you need to install it. The package name is: `libtext-lorem-perl`
If the package is not available use the following command and redirect its output to a file: `curl http://metaphorpsum.com/sentences/5`
4. Add the new file to the archive.
5. List all the members of the archive.
