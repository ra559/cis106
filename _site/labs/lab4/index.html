  <li>Presentations:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://rapurl.live/uz0">How to navigate the filesystem</a></li>
      <li>Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@linuxworkshop6337">here</a></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong>
Questions 1 AND 2 are worth 50 points. Question 3 has no grade. Question 4 and 5 are worth 50 points. So each question here is worth 25 points. In the video, I only complete question 1, 2 and 3. You have to do question 4 and 5 on your own. Your final exam will include questions similar to 4 and 5. I will answer questions 4 and 5 during class after the due date for this lab full has expired.</p>
