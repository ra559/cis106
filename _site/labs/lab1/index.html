<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>
<p>During class, we explored the concept of Linux distribution. During this lab, you will research some Linux distributions using a website called Distrowatch. DistroWatch is a website that provides news, popularity rankings, and other general information about various Linux distributions and other Unix-like operating systems such as OpenSolaris, MINIX and BSD.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://distrowatch.com/">Distrowatch</a>. Explore the website to get familiar with the home page. On the top left corner, you have a form that allows you to submit queries to the website. In the <strong>“Type Distribution Name”</strong> box type <strong>“Ubuntu”.</strong>  This will return details about Ubuntu. Explore the Ubuntu Distrowatch page and answer the following questions:</p>

<h3 id="question-6">Question 6</h3>
<p>DistroTest.net is a project that allows you to test Linux/BSD distributions on your web browser. This website is great for trying out distributions before you even download the ISO file. Go to <a href="https://distrotest.net/">Distrotest.net</a> and click on any of the distributions. Start the distribution and take a screenshot of the browser window that just popped up.</p>

<p><strong>Place Screenshot here</strong></p>

<p>Locate the terminal application in the distribution you started and type the following command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uname -a</code> Take a screenshot of the browser window showing the terminal application open.</p>

<p><strong>Place Screenshot here</strong></p>
