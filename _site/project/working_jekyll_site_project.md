## Description
This tutorial will show you how to install Jekyll and run a single page site. We will complete everything in a Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine with VirtualBox 7 as the hypervisor.

## Step 1
1. Create a virtual machine that meets the following criteria:

| Hardware        | Requirement     |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| CPU             | 2 Cores         |
| RAM             | 2 GB            |
| Storage         | 50 GB           |
| Video Memory    | 128 MB          |
| 3D Acceleration | Enabled         |
| Audio Card      | Disabled        |

1. Install Ubuntu Desktop 22.04. You can follow this guide to install Ubuntu 22.04. 
   1. Note to self: I need to create a base guide to install Ubuntu 22.04 Destop and update the Installing Ubuntu 22.04 Server Guide. This will make the lab smaller. I also should make a base guide for creating a virtual machine.
   2. This project is paused until those guides are made.
