## Weekly Homework  #
This is a list of task that you will be required to complete every week. 
- Complete the designated lab **(40 Minutes)**
    - Each lab has a video walkthrough from beginning to end available in the course Youtube Channel. 
    - Each lab is a hands on activity consisting of 5 questions or less that also include a challenge question. 
    - I advise you to complete the labs in one sitting to avoid losing any data.
    - Labs are the corner stone of this course and as a result you are required to complete them in the designated order. You cannot do the next week's lab if you do not complete the previous week lab as they build on each other.
- Complete the assigned discussion board **(30 Minutes)**
    - Every week you will have either a video, podcast episode, or article to read.
    - After you complete the assigned material, you are required to answer 1 question.
    - To receive full grade, you must create a post with your answer and reply to someone else's post as well. 
- Complete Weekly Report **(30 minutes)**
    - A document written in markdown containing the following
        - A summary of the lecture's presentation
        - Screenshots when needed
        - Example of the commands/technoligies covered during the lecture
        - The first weekly report has a video. The video exist to show you what I am expecting from you and a clear example of how to do the work. This prevents you from losing points.
        - Only Markdown format and a pdf converted from the markdown file is accepted. **No Word Documents!**
- Complete Final Project assignment **(30 Minutes)**
    - You are required to work on your final project on a week by week basis. This prevents procrðŸŒŸastination. 
    - You will submit your project in a Markdown file as well. 
    - You will have specific questions to complete that will lead you to a complete project by the end of the semester. 


The total study time is 2.16 hours. However, this is on average. Chances are that you may have to spend more time working on each task depending on how good you are with computers. 

Do not leave this for the last minute. I will not grant you any extra time without a good reason and procrastination is not a good one. If leave the assignment for the last hour of the week and your computer breaks, that is your problem, I will not grant you any extra time. 

I will not be taking late assignments. If you have not submitted your work, you get a zero.
