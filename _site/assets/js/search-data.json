The following are options: * A virtual machine (Preferred) * A laptop/Desktop computer that you can wipe. * Access to Blackboard * A Github account * A Text editor. We will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use whatever you want * 2 Hours of study time * Capable of adjusting to fast paced course * **For virtualization** * A decent PC that meets or exceeds these requirements: * Quad-Core Processor or modern Dual-Core Processor 2.5 Ghz * 8 Gb of RAM * Windows 10/11 * 100 Gb of free space * **Knowledge of the following** * Basic components of a personal computer * Basic usage of a personal computer * Internet browsing * Reading emails * Chat Applications * Office Productivity Suites (MS Office, Google Docs, etc) * Install/Remove Software * Difference between web browser, the internet, and a search engine > Not knowing this things does not mean you will fail the course. It means that you will have to spend extra time studying. ## Advice * If you find that the content of the course is too much or that you have too many gaps in your knowledge, I suggest that you take this course after CIS 180 and CIS 116. * If you do not have a decent computer (one that can be used for virtualization) you will have a very poor experience in this course. For this reason, I have alocated a computer in the lab (H311) that you can use. You will need to contact me ahead of time so I can setup a user for you. ## Resources * **Books** * [The Linux Command Line By William Shotts](https://bit.ly/34Og1Bp) * [Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide 4th Edition](http://bit.ly/34QaA4O) * [Free Linux Magazine with good command line reference](https://bit.ly/2LY0JTW) * [Free book. wont be used but it is good to have](http://www.it-docs.net/ddata/900.pdf) * [Raspberry Models Comparison](http://bit.ly/3qrkjHb) * **Github Markdown** * [Github Markdown Syntax Cheat sheet](https://bit.ly/3p3WLIp) * [Github Markdown syntax official documentation](http://bit.ly/3pvKZpE) * [Git Cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet) * [Linux cheat sheets](https://github.com/ra559/linux_cheat_sheets/tree/main) ",

It will give you an idea of what we are trying to do here. * Please go slow and take your time to do this lab. It is long but it is the core of this course. * If you do not have a computer that meets the recommended criteria, **please reach out to me and stop doing this lab.** * Be aware that the presentations use an earlier version of Ubuntu but the changes are not that significant and you should be able to follow along. > **NOTE!** > * Only start this lab after you have watched the videos or read the presentations. > * If your computer does not meet the required hardware, you will not be able to complete the course as we will be running 2 virtual machines near the end of the semester. ## Question 1 | Enable virtualization Before you can create virtual machines, you need to know if your computer can virtualize. There are a couple of steps you need to follow to find out the answer to this question: ### MacOS users 1. For those using MacOS, if you have a recent Apple computer (M1 CPU), you will not be able to use Virtualbox, there is another hypervisor you can use but I have not been able to test it since I do not own an M1 Mac where I can test it. You can watch and follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnwK-nkXolc). Again, I have not tested this option therefore you are on your own. ![Warning](/assets/warning-icon_1_15.png) > ***from past semester experience, I cannot recommend MacOS with M1 CPUs. The experience is very poor and students have encountered too many problems at the level where they cannot complete the work on time. Proceed at your own risk*** 2. If you have an older Mac (Inter Version), you can user virtualbox as it is fully supported. Just make sure your Mac has enough resources to run virtual machines. For intel Macs, virtualization is already enabled and you can just follow this guide/video. ### Windows Users Follow these steps: 1. Find out what hardware your computer has: 1. CPU and number of cores 2. Amount of RAM 3. Amount of Free Storage 2. If your computer does not meet the criteria below, stop this lab and get in contact with me. We may be able to find an alternative for you but this can only be done on a 1 on 1 basis. **REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS:** - CPU: Quad core CPU - RAM: 8GB or More - Free Storage: 60GB or more ![Warning](/assets/warning-icon.png) > If you do not meed these requirements but your computer is close enough, you may be able to complete the course material. The downside is that your computer will be extremely slow. If your computer meets or exceeds the above capabilities, then you need to check if virtualization is enabled. Follow [this guide](https://rapurl.live/vaj) to know if your computer has virtualization enabled and if it does not, use the same guide to learn how to enable it. You can also use [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) to find out if your computer has virtualization enabled. If you are having troubles enabling virtualization, let me know immediately. **DO NOT WAIT FOR THE LAST MINUTE!** This part can take time! Take a screenshot showing your computer specifications and a screenshot of the task manager showing virtualization has been enabled. MacOS user should only take a screenshot of the computer specs. Here is an example: | Computer specs | Virtualization | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ![specs](/assets/windowsspecs.jpeg) | ![virt](/assets/taskmanagervirtenabled.png) | . ## Question 2 | Create a Virtual Machine Before you can create virtual machines, you need to install VirtualBox and VirtualBox Extension Pack. To download Vbox and the extension pack go to: * [Virtualbox Download Page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) * [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) Make sure to select the right installer for your operating system: ![VirtualBox Download page](/assets/vboxdownloadpage.png) Make sure to install VirtualBox in your host computer. For Windows follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGmCwpFYi8). For macOS follow this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyx53lJyAoc) Once you have installed VirtualBox, create a virtual machine that meets these specifications: > * OS: Ubuntu 22.04 64Bits [ISO URL](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) > * HDD: 40 GB > * RAM: 2GB > * Video: 64 MB or Higher > * Audio Controller: Disabled (audio won't be needed) > * CPU: 2 Cores > * Add this to description: > * **Hostname:** cis106vm > * **User:** student name (use your blackboard username) > * **Password:** pccc > * Shared Clipboard: Enabled - Bidirectional > * Drag n' Drop: Enabled - Bidirectional ![Create VM](/assets/createVM.gif) > Take a screenshot of your virtual machine settings. You screenshot must show all the settings of your VM. Here is a proper example: | virtual machine settings | --------------------------------------- | ![](/assets/virtualmachinesettings.png) | . ## Question 3 | Install Ubuntu 22.04 * Go over the presentation [\"Installing Ubuntu 20.04 in VirtualBox\"](https://shorturl.at/hlor0). There, I have laid out every step with proper explanations. The presentation is using an earlier version of Virtualbox and Ubuntu but the differences are not very significant. I will do it in the video as well but it will benefit you to read the presentation. > Take a screenshot of the last screen before rebooting Ubuntu. If you missed it, take a screenshot of the welcome message or the desktop on first boot. ## Question 4 | Post Installation Tasks These are the tasks that you need to complete before taking the screenshots: * Update and upgrade * Add canonical partners in the software settings * Set update daily reminder to never * Change Wayland for X.org * Take snapshot. * Install the guest additions for virtualbox. * Run this command: `sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y` * Use this [video](https://youtu.be/IuqJxbYuU-Y) to install guest additions. * Reboot the VM * Go Full Screen * Disable animations. Run this command on your terminal: `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false` > Take a screenshot of your virtual machine showing the snapshot. Here is an example: ![vm snapshot](/assets/snapshot.png) . ## Question 5 | Complete the following tasks 1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Install all the extensions of VS Code * Live Server * Markdown All in one * Markdown Preview Enhanced * Markdown PDF * Markdown TOC * Markdown Converter * PDF Preview * Code Spell Checker 2. Using the terminal, remove all unnecessary applications from Ubuntu 22.04. Use this command: ``` sudo apt purge apport aisleriot gnome-mahjongg gnome-sudoku gnome-mines -y ``` 3. Using the software center install the following applications: * flameshot * vlc * deluge * geany * tilix > In the terminal you can use these command: `sudo apt install flameshot vlc deluge geany tilix -y` 4. Using the terminal install the following applications: gcc make perl nemo git python3-pip gnome-tweaks curl snapd flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak gnome-software-plugin-snap wget tree htop net-tools vim neofetch caffeine samba smbclient cifs-utils. You can use the following commands: * `sudo apt install gcc make perl nemo git python3-pip -y` * `sudo apt install curl wget tree htop net-tools vim -y` * `sudo apt install neofetch caffeine samba smbclient gnome-tweaks -y` * `sudo apt install snapd flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak gnome-software-plugin-snap -y` * `sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons -y` 5. Replace the default screenshot tool with flameshot. ### Setup Git and download your repository to your Ubuntu machine. 1. Sign in to your Github account. 2. Open a terminal and run the following commands: 3. Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 4. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` 5. Setup SSH authentication 6. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 7. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. 8. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboard in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 9. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` 10. Clone your github repository. Use these commands: `cd; git clone git@github.com:yourGithub-User-Name-Here/your-Repository-Name-Here` 11. Open a file manager and go to the repository you cloned (the folder) and organize the files as I do in the video. 12. Open VS Code and open your repository folder. 13. Open a terminal in VS Code and run the following commands: `git add .; git commit -m \"Files organized\"; git push` 14. Open your github repository and your web browser and noticed how the files are now organized as they are in your computer. ## Time to submit this lab. * Inside your repository folder, create a new folder called `lab2` * Copy the screenshots you took from your windows computer to your vm by dragging and dropping the files in the newly created `lab2` folder * Place those files in a folder called: `lab2` * Inside the lab2 folder create a new file named: `lab2.md` * Open your repository in VS code and complete the document `lab2.md` with your screenshots * Save the file. * Convert the file to PDF. * Commit and push the changes to github. Use this command: `git add .; git commit -m \"Lab2 finished\"; git push` ## What will you Submit: * The URL to the lab2.md file and a pdf file of lab2. * Turn off your Virtual Machine properly. Avoid closing the Virtual Machine Window as this can break the virtual machine. * Take a snapshot of your virtual machine. ![Warning](/assets/warning-icon.png) ### Special Note This is a canonical lab for your learning. You will be making more virtual machines in the future. I suggest you create more virtual machines and then delete them. For example, find out what are the minimum requirements for installing windows 10 and then make a windows 10 virtual machine. Also, install other linux distributions as well. You do not need to keep these vms just use this lab to practice. Remember, when deleting virtual machines, make sure to select `delete all files` instead of just removing the vms. This will make sure that you recover your hard drive space. ",

The point of this question is to get you familiar with the system. The more you use Ubuntu, the less intimidating it becomes. 1. Open a terminal and type the `date` command. Take a screenshot of the terminal and highlight the date command. Add some text to the screenshot. Save your screenshot in your `lab3` directory inside your github repository. If the `lab3` directory does not exist, create it. 2. **Create a desktop shortcut for the cis106 website** * Open a text editor. * Add the following text: ``` #!/usr/bin/evn xdg-open [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Terminal=false Exec=/snap/bin/firefox https://cis106.com Name=cis106 Icon=$HOME/.cis106.png ``` * Save the file with the name: `cis106.desktop` and save it in your Desktop directory. * On the desktop, right click on the file `cis106.desktop` and enable launching (can also be called: `Allow executing as program`): ![allow launching](/assets/allowLanuching.gif) * Now lets add the launcher to our favorites application in the Dock: * Run the following command: ``` cp Desktop/cis106.desktop .local/share/applications/ ``` * Now run this command: ``` dconf write /org/gnome/shell/favorite-apps \"['firefox_firefox.desktop', 'org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop', 'org.gnome.Terminal.desktop', 'code.desktop', 'cis106.desktop']\" ``` 1. **Write a Document** 1. Open Libre office writer. 2. Go on firefox and copy and paste some text from wikipedia 3. Convert the file to pdf 4. Save the pdf file in the `lab3` directory inside your github repository. 2. **Create a Presentation in LibreOffice Impress** 1. save the presentation in the `lab3` directory 3. **Play around with the settings of Ubuntu** 1. Click on the System Tray. Open \"Settings\" 2. Change the background. 3. Go to this [site](https://wallhaven.cc/) and download a new wallpaper and add it as a background. 4. Play around with the appearance of Ubuntu. 5. Play around with the notifications 6. Disable search for everything except software 7. Change the screen blank to \"Never\" in the power settings 8. Take a look at the rest of the settings 4. **Install a Font** 1. Go to this [website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) 2. Download the following fonts: 1. FiraCode Nerd Font 2. FiraMono Nerd Font 3. Inconsolata Nerd Font 4. InconsolataGo Nerd Font 5. Iosevka Nerd Font 6. JetBrainsMono Nerd Font 7. Lekton Nerd Font 8. Monofur Nerd Font 9. Monoki Nerd Font 10. SpaceMono Nerd Font 5. [Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/) is an advance terminal emulator that supports split screen and other advanced features. Open Tilix, and do the following: 1. Open the app settings, in the Appearance tab, change the theme variant to dark 2. Add a background image. Like this [one](https://wallpapersmug.com/download/1920x1080/6d3c26/dark-minimal-mountains.png) 3. In the Default profile, 1. Change the font to any of the font you downloaded earlier. I suggest Fira Mono 2. Change the Cursor to: Underline 3. Change the Cursor blink mode: ON 4. Set the color Scheme to Linux 5. Adjust the transparency until the background is slightly visible > This question requires no screenshot ## Question 2 | Using a different desktop environment 1. Install Gnome Classic. GNOME Classic is a GNOME Shell feature and mode for users who prefer a more traditional desktop experience. Read more [here](https://rapurl.live/vgo) * Open a terminal and run this command: ``` sudo apt update; sudo apt install gnome-session-flashback -y ``` * Log out and select the gnome classic session in the gear icon. Log in. ![switchingde](/assets/switchinge-de.gif) > Take a screenshot of your ubuntu system. > **Note:** *You can go back to Gnome 42 if you want.* . ## Question 2.1 (Alternative - Not required!)| Customizing Ubuntu 22.04 Appearance and behavior > This question is not mandatory is done for the sake of practicing some more. Feel free to ignore this. 1. Turn your virtual machine off and take a snapshot. 2. In the logging screen select Gnome 42 instead of Gnome Classic Metacity 3. Using the software center, install the application Gnome Extension Manager. 4. Open Extension Manager and install the following extensions: 1. Blur My Shell 2. Burn My Windows 3. CoverFlow Alt-Tab 4. Dash to Panel 5. Vitals 5. Enable desktop animations using this command: `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations true` > Warning: All of these extensions will make your virtual machine slow. I suggest going back to the default Gnome Session without extensions or disabling the ones that add all the fancy effects. If you are ok with your current setup, leave it as is. > This question does not require a screenshot ## Question 3 | Installing applications Using the command line, look for a software to do each of the following tasks and then complete the table with the information you found. Make sure that the application you found is an actual software and not a library. If needed Google the application name to be sure before you install the program. Install and launch the application. 1. Play a tetris game 2. Play a video file 3. Browse the internet 4. Read your email 5. Play music ``` | Program purpose | Package Name | Version | ------------------- | ------------ | ------- | Play a tetris game | | Play a video file | | Browse the internet | | Read your email | | Play music | | ``` > Take a screenshot of each application open. ## Question 4 | Trying out simple commands (CHALLENGE QUESTION) Almost all Linux commands include manual pages. Manual pages (man page for short) is a documentation that explains the usage of a command. Man pages are not user friendly and are not meant to be guides but references on how a program works. The more you read man pages the more sense they make. It is normal to feel lost in the beginning. To read the manual of a command simply type: `man command name` for example, `man date` opens the manual of the date command. To move around the man page, use the arrow keys in the keyboard. You can also use the mouse wheel if you are working in a terminal emulator. To get help on how to read the manual press letter `h` to quit the manual page press `q` Try the following commands in the terminal 1. date 2. free -h 3. uname -a 4. du / * Use the internet and the manual page to understand **What each command does?** * Install these programs: `fortune cowsay toilet figlet rig lolcat boxes` * Run these commands on your terminal: 1. `echo \"I Like Linux!\" | lolcat` 2. `fortune | cowsay | lolcat` 3. `figlet \"Linux is cool\"` 4. `fortune | toilet -f term -F border --metal` 5. `rig | boxes -d boy` Use the man page to find out what each of these programs do then fill in the table. ``` | command | what it does | ------- | ------------ | echo | | fortune | | cowsay | | lolcat | | figlet | | toilet | | rig | ``` ## What will you submit * Create a markdown file named `lab3.md` and answer all the questions there. * Submit the URL to the lab3.md file in github and a pdf version of `lab3.md` file.

    "content": "# {{page.title}} ## A Brief description of the wildcards. ![wildcards](/assets/wildcardcheatsheet.png) > Cheat Sheet [here](https://rapurl.live/zot) Video [here](https://youtu.be/-1AKNwCo4hY) > **Note:** Wildcards are all about pattern matching. They can be confusing but once you get a hold of them, you will never forget them. The table above gives you a summary of each wildcard. The goal of this lab is to give you enough practice for you to master wildcards in their basics form. Wildcards are very powerful because they can be combined to match pretty much any pattern that you can think of. ## IMPORTANT!!! READ ME!!!!! > Before working on this lab, run this command: **`curl https://cis106.com/assets/lab6.sh | bash`** This will create a directory called `lab6` in your home directory . ## Question 1 | Using the * Wildcard > In your home directory, you should have a directory called `lab6`, if you don't have it, make sure to run the curl command in the `READ ME` part of this lab. 1. List all the `log` files located in the `lab6` directory. 2. Create a directory called `log-files` inside the `lab6` directory. Move all the log files to the `log-files` directory. 3. List all the configuration files in the `etc` directory. (*Configuration files have the extension of .conf*) 4. Long list all the configuration files in the `etc` directory that start with letter `h` or letter `p` **sorted by file size**. Modify the ls command with the proper options so that the output looks like this: (*Notice the date*) ``` -rw-r--r-- 1 7.5K 08/19/21 /etc/pnm2ppa.conf ``` > You can see a full list of control characters for the date [here](https://cis106.com/guides/format-control-char-date-command/) **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . ## Question 2 | Using the ? wildcard 1. List only the hidden files inside the `lab6` directory. 2. List all the files with a 2 letter file extension in the `lab6` directory 3. Inside the `lab6` directory, list all the files that start with letter `l`, have one character after letter `l`, and the letters `st`. The the rest of the file name is irrelevant. 4. Inside the `lab6` directory, list all the files that have an `_` and two characters before the file extension. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . ## Question 3 | Using the [] Wildcard 1. List all the files that start with an uppercase letter 2. List all the files that start with an uppercase letter or a number 3. List all the files that have a number in the file name 4. List all the files that start with a lowercase letter and have a number before the file extension. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . ## Question 4 | Using brace expansion. The curly braces are not a wildcard but they are equally useful. The curly braces allow you to generate arbitrary strings to use with commands. **Problem 1:** In the `lab6` directory, create the following directory structure. Display a tree of the directory. **Take a screenshot**: ``` wallpapers/ └── cars ├── 1080p ├── 2k └── 4k ``` **Problem 2:** Clear your terminal. in the `lab6` directory, create the following directory structure. Display a tree of the directory. **Take a screenshot**: ``` assets/ ├── imgs │   ├── large │   └── small └── video ├── large └── small ``` **Problem 3:** Clear your terminal. in the `lab6` directory, create the following directory structure. You need to create the pdf files as well. Remember mkdir creates directories while touch creates files. Display a tree of the directory. **Take a screenshot**: ``` docs/ └── books ├── history │   ├── fall │   │   └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) │   └── spring │   └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) └── math ├── fall │   └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) └── spring └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) ``` **Problem 4:** Brace expansion comes handy in other scenarios too. Here are some examples: 1. Create a directory in your home directory called `lab6-q5`. From the root of the filesystem create 3 files in the lab6-q5 directory called: `program.py`, `people.csv`, `data.xls`. 2. Change your current working directory to `/usr/share`. Create a directory in the `lab6-q5` directory called `movies`. Create 3 files in the `~/lab6-q5/movies` directory called `movies.lst`, `marvel.txt` and `disney.doc`. 3. Remove the files: `program.py`, `people.csv`, `disney.doc`, and `marvel.txt`. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . # Challenge Question > Run this curl command: **`curl https://cis106.com/assets/lab6cq.sh | bash`** This will create a directory in your home directory called: `challenge-Lab6` This directory has a bunch of files. Organize these file so that each file type has its own directory. Each file type must be moved to its respective directory. When you are done, the `challenge-Lab6` directory should look like this: ``` challenge-lab6/ ├── audio │   ├── aac │   │   └── all-aac-files-here │   └── mp3 │   └── all-mp3-files-here ├── docs │   ├── docx │   │   └── all-docs-files-here │   ├── pdf │   │   └── all-pdf-files-here │   └── xls │   └── all-xls-files-here └── images ├── jpg │   └── all-jpg-files-here └── png └── all-png-files-here ``` *Tips* * Try to create your directory structure in a single command. * Try working with multiple terminal windows open. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** ## What will you Submit: * Place all the screenshots and answers to your questions in a the `lab6.md` file. * Convert your markdown file to pdf * Push the changes to Github: `git pull; git add .; git commit -m \"lab5 complete; git push\"` * Submit the URL of `lab6.md` and the pdf file * Take a snapshot of your system and delete the previous snapshot.

The easiest way to do this is to make sure that the network addapter in the viertual machine is set to bridge instead of nat. To do this go, open the virtual machine settings and in the network section change the adapter to Bridge. ![network adapter](/assets/networkadapter.png) * However, your network may prevent you from doing this. Some IDS and smart routers may prevent you from getting an IP. In this case, you need to use [port forwarding](https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding) in your virtual machine. Here is a [guide](shorturl.at/ckHR8) on how to do it. ### Portforwarding Example ![portforwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) * Make sure that the ssh server program is installed in the server virtual machine ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` * Make sure that the ssh client program is installed in the client machine. This is the computer that you will be using to manage your server. ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` * Enable and start ssh in the server: ``` sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh ``` * Test the connection by loging in to the server from the client. First, use the ip or hostname command to find out the ip address of the server. * On the server type, `hostname -I` this will give you the ip address of your server. * On the client type: ``` ssh username@server-ip-address ``` * If you are using port forwarding, your command will be: ``` ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 ``` * Read and answer the questions and you will connect sucessfully. ## Setup private and public key authentication with or without password: * On the server, configure the firewall to accept ssh connections. ``` sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw enable sudo ufw status ``` * Now we need to generate an ssh key in our client computer. If you are using your ubuntu machine from the course, then you already have one. If you are not, then you must create the ssh keys: * In your client machine type: ``` ssh-keygen ``` * Now you can type this command to copy your ssh key to the server ``` ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub webmaster@server-ip-address ``` * if you are using port forwarding, use this command instead: ``` ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 2222 webmaster@127.0.0.1 ``` > if you use port forwarding your command will be: ``` ssh-copy-id -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 ``` * Now you can connect to your server without having to remember the password.

Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 2. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` ## Setup SSH authentication 1. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 2. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. See examle here: 3. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboad in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 4. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` You will see the following outcome: > If you do not see an error message or a different message than the one shown prior, then your SSH connection is correct.

During the installation, make sure that you follow these specifications: * Keyboard layout: English US * Installation type: Normal with third party software, Erase disk * Timezone: NY * User Details * Name: Student * Hostname: cis106vm * Username: Student * Password: pccc * Require login (Important) ![Installation](../imgs/installation.gif) # Post Installation Settings Once the operating system has been installed, make sure to take a snapshot of your machine. This is a good idea because if something goes wrong, you can revert back to the virtual machine state. Think of snapshots as a way of traveling back in time! * Update and upgrade * Remove unnecessary software * Essential software install * Disable animations * Change Default File Manager: Nemo * Change Default screenshot tool with flameshot * Enable Dark Theme You can do all of the above with a single command. * `sudo apt install curl -y; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ra559/cis106/main/guides/oneliner.sh | bash` Install restricted extras, which is a package that contains other essential software that is normally not included by default because of copyright issues, being closed source or any other controversial reason. For instance, Microsoft core fonts are part of the restricted extras. * `sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons -y` ## Install Guest Additions This step is for VirtualBox only. Skip if using any other hypervisor. For instance, in VMware Workstation Player, these are installed via the command line without the need of a virtual disk. Guest Additions are a collection of software that gives the virtual machine more functionality and better performance. For instance, you having the Guest Additions installed allows you to use the full resolution of your monitor and to share the clipboard between your host and the guest OS. ![Guest additions](../imgs/install%20guest%20additions.gif) ## Change Desktop Environment The default desktop environment in Ubuntu 20.04 is Gnome 3. However, Gnome 3 is a heavy desktop environment not recommended for a low end machine with the specifications such as the one our virtual machine has. This is the reason why we will be using Gnome Classic which is a fork of the old Gnome 2 Desktop environment. Gnome Classic consumes considerably less system resources while remaining easy to use and functional enough. * Replace GDM with Lightdm: `sudo apt install lightdm -y` * Set default Desktop Environment to Gnome Flashback ![Gnome Classic](../imgs/setGnomeClassic.gif) ### VS Code setup VS Code is the text editor that we will use through out the semester to write our notes, labs, homeworks, and final project documentation. To make VS Code more functional, we will install a series of extensions. 1. Install VS Code Extensions: 1. Live Server 2. Markdown All in one 3. Markdown Preview Enhanced 4. Markdown PDF 5. Markdown TOC 6. PDF Preview 7. Markdown Converter 8. Code Spell Checker ",

The default configuration is located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myresume.conf` 8. Add the following text to the domain config file: ``` ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName myresume ServerAlias www.myresume DocumentRoot /var/www/myresume ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ``` 9.

Now lets disable the default domain:`sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf` 12. Before we can refresh the configuration, we need to add a configuration line to the `apache2.conf` file. Open the file in nano:`sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf` 13. Add the following line at the end of the file:`ServerName 127.0.0.1` 14. Save and close the file when you are finished.

This will update the Ubuntu installer and proceed with the installation. ### Step 4 ![Step 4](/assets/step-4-keyboard-select.png) This step will automatically select the language layout of your keyboard. If for whatever reason it is different than what your physical keyboard has, then manually adjust it. ### Step 5 ![Step 5](/assets/Step-5-install-type.png) Choose the default Ubuntu Server installation. We will need some of the repositories in the default installation. ### Step 6 ![Step 6](/assets/step-6-ip-address.png) Since we are installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine that at the moment is configured to have a NAT network interface card, as long as your host PC has internet connection, you should automatically get an IP address. If you don't, something is wrong with your VM, Host Machine, or Internet Connection. > Note: If you are doing this project in the school's network, be aware that the school's routers are configured to block Bridged Ethernet adapters. ### Step 7 ![Step 7](/assets/step-7-proxy.png) Leave this part empty as we are not using a proxy. ### Step 8 ![step 8](/assets/step-8-mirror.png) We will use the default mirror so there is no need to change this ### Step 9 ![Step 9](/assets/step-9-disk.png) This step is to format our disk. Here we will select the entire disk. To move around here use either the arrow keys or the tab key. ### Step 10 ![Step 10](/assets/step-10-confirm-disk.png) ![Step 10.1](/assets/step-10-1-confirm-disk.png) This step is just to let you know the changes that will be made to the server's virtual hard drive. ### Step 11 ![Step 11](/assets/step-11-server-info.png) Here you will enter the information about your computer. Write this information down because you will needed it later. ### Step 12 ![Step 12](/assets/step-12-ssh.png) It is a good idea to install ssh now as we will use it later on. Do not import SSH keys. We will do that manually later. ### Step 13 ![Step 13](/assets/step-13-services.png) Do not select these services. We won't be using them. ### Step 14 ![Step 14](/assets/step-14-installation.png) This is the installation process. Once it is done it will start updating the system. Once the update is done, it will ask you to reboot. ### Step 15 ![Step 15](/assets/step-15-reboot-now.png) ### Step 16 ![Step 16](/assets/step-16-press-enter.png) Here Just press enter. Virtualbox will unmount the installation disk for you ## Part 3 Install Apache First, login to the server. You will need to type your username and password. Here is an example: ![log in](/assets/loging-in-ubuntu-server.gif) Notice that the password is hidden while typing just like when you are typing it in the terminal emulator. Be aware that during the upgrade, Ubuntu will ask you to restart some services. Apache is available in Ubuntu's default repositories. However, before we can start installing new packages, let's update the system: ``` sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y ``` ![Update Ubuntu](/assets/update-ubuntu-server.gif) To install Apache use: ``` sudo apt install apache2 -y ``` ![install apache](/assets/install-apache.gif) Be aware that here you will also need to restart some services here. ## Part 4 Setup SSH #### Before Setup Before we can setup SSH, we need to enable the firewall. Use this command: ``` sudo ufw enable ``` Now lets configure ufw to allow Apache and SSH traffic: ``` sudo ufw allow 'Apache' sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH' ``` Now check the status of the firewall: ``` sudo ufw status ``` ![firewall](/assets/firewallcheck.gif) Now lets check the status of Apache and SSH to make sure they are running: ``` systemctl status apache2 --no-pager systemctl status ssh --no-pager ``` Both commands should return `active (running)` if they do not, restart the services with the command: ``` sudo systemctl restart apache2 ssh ``` ![service status check](/assets/service-status-check.gif) #### Setup Port forwarding 1. Turn off the server virtual machine if it is on. 2. Go to the network virtual machine configuration for the server. There add port forwarding to the NAT configuration. You will need to forward port 22 to 2222 and port 80 t0 8080. Here is a screenshot: ![Port forwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) 3. Turn on the server. Make sure that the ssh server program is installed in the server virtual machine: ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` 4. Enable and start ssh in the server: ``` sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh ``` 5. Test the connection by logging in to the server from the client. In this case, your client is your Host computer terminal application (in Windows, it is the CMD or powershell) ``` ssh -p 2222 username_of_the_server@127.0.0.1 ``` 6. Read and answer the questions and you will connect sucessfully. ## Part 5 Setup virtual hosts Virtual host allows us to serve more than one website in a single web server. By default, Apache has one server block enabled. This server block is served from the directory: `/var/www/html`. For a single website, all the files are placed within this directory. When we setup virtual hosts, each site has its own directory. The recommendation is to leave the default `html` directory and for each site a new directory inside `/var/www`. In this project, we will have one virtual site called `myresume`. You are welcome to use a different name just remember to adjust every command where the word `myresume` is reference for your preferred website domain name. **Follow These Steps** 1. Create the directory for `myresume` as follows: `sudo mkdir /var/www/myresume` 2. Modify the ownership of `myresume` so that it is now owned by your user instead of root `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/myresume` 3. Now let's change the file permission so that the owner can read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others: `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/myresume` 4. Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called `index.html` in the `/var/www/myresume/` directory: `sudo nano /var/www/myresume/index.html`. 5. Once the new document opens, type the following text: ``` My Resume Website . ",

Now we need to create a virtual host file so that this new content can be served. The default configuration is located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myresume.conf` 8. Add the following text to the domain config file: ``` ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName myresume ServerAlias www.myresume DocumentRoot /var/www/myresume ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ``` 9. Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. 10. Now enable the site with the following command: `sudo a2ensite myresume.conf` 11. Now lets disable the default domain:`sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf` 12. Before we can refresh the configuration, we need to add a configuration line to the `apache2.conf` file. Open the file in nano:`sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf` 13. Add the following line at the end of the file:`ServerName 127.0.0.1` 14. Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. 15. Now you can test the configuration for errors:`sudo apache2ctl configtest` 16. The output of the command should look like this: ``` Syntax OK ``` 17. If there are no errors, restart Apache to apply the changes:`sudo systemctl restart apache2` ![Setup Virtual Host 2](/assets/setup-virtual-host-2.gif) 18.

This will update the Ubuntu installer and proceed with the installation. ### Step 4 ![Step 4](/assets/step-4-keyboard-select.png) This step will automatically select the language layout of your keyboard. If for whatever reason it is different than what your physical keyboard has, then manually adjust it. ### Step 5 ![Step 5](/assets/Step-5-install-type.png) Choose the default Ubuntu Server installation. We will need some of the repositories in the default installation. ### Step 6 ![Step 6](/assets/step-6-ip-address.png) Since we are installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine that at the moment is configured to have a NAT network interface card, as long as your host PC has internet connection, you should automatically get an IP address. If you don't, something is wrong with your VM, Host Machine, or Internet Connection. > Note: If you are doing this project in the school's network, be aware that the school's routers are configured to block Bridged Ethernet adapters. ### Step 7 ![Step 7](/assets/step-7-proxy.png) Leave this part empty as we are not using a proxy. ### Step 8 ![step 8](/assets/step-8-mirror.png) We will use the default mirror so there is no need to change this ### Step 9 ![Step 9](/assets/step-9-disk.png) This step is to format our disk. Here we will select the entire disk. To move around here use either the arrow keys or the tab key. ### Step 10 ![Step 10](/assets/step-10-confirm-disk.png) ![Step 10.1](/assets/step-10-1-confirm-disk.png) This step is just to let you know the changes that will be made to the server's virtual hard drive. ### Step 11 ![Step 11](/assets/step-11-server-info.png) Here you will enter the information about your computer. Write this information down because you will needed it later. ### Step 12 ![Step 12](/assets/step-12-ssh.png) It is a good idea to install ssh now as we will use it later on. Do not import SSH keys. We will do that manually later. ### Step 13 ![Step 13](/assets/step-13-services.png) Do not select these services. We won't be using them. ### Step 14 ![Step 14](/assets/step-14-installation.png) This is the installation process. Once it is done it will start updating the system. Once the update is done, it will ask you to reboot. ### Step 15 ![Step 15](/assets/step-15-reboot-now.png) ### Step 16 ![Step 16](/assets/step-16-press-enter.png) Here Just press enter. Virtualbox will unmount the installation disk for you ## Part 3 Install Apache First, login to the server. You will need to type your username and password. Here is an example: ![log in](/assets/loging-in-ubuntu-server.gif) Notice that the password is hidden while typing just like when you are typing it in the terminal emulator. Be aware that during the upgrade, Ubuntu will ask you to restart some services. Apache is available in Ubuntu's default repositories. However, before we can start installing new packages, let's update the system: ``` sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y ``` ![Update Ubuntu](/assets/update-ubuntu-server.gif) To install Apache use: ``` sudo apt install apache2 -y ``` ![install apache](/assets/install-apache.gif) Be aware that here you will also need to restart some services here. ## Part 4 Setup SSH #### Before Setup Before we can setup SSH, we need to enable the firewall. Use this command: ``` sudo ufw enable ``` Now lets configure ufw to allow Apache and SSH traffic: ``` sudo ufw allow 'Apache' sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH' ``` Now check the status of the firewall: ``` sudo ufw status ``` ![firewall](/assets/firewallcheck.gif) Now lets check the status of Apache and SSH to make sure they are running: ``` systemctl status apache2 --no-pager systemctl status ssh --no-pager ``` Both commands should return `active (running)` if they do not, restart the services with the command: ``` sudo systemctl restart apache2 ssh ``` ![service status check](/assets/service-status-check.gif) ### Change the Network Adapter **Follow these steps:** 1. Turn off the server virtual machine using this command: `sudo shutdown now` 2. Change the server network adapter configuration from NAT to Bridge. ![Network Adapter](/assets/networkadapter.png) >However, there is a chance that using a bridge adapter won't work for you. Some IDS (Instruction Detection Systems) and smart routers may prevent you from getting an Ip Address if your Network Adapter is bridge. In this case, you need to use [port forwarding](https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding) in your virtual machine. Here is an example: ![portforwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) ### Connect with SSH ![ssh connection](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTQha8cbvbsKtr6D7fqbP3CZ64F9sFTVqWpxEwvpJfg5VymCf5a6rutXUkzd3R3CTFSS9JXBt4BmOU-/pub?w=502&h=200) **Follow these steps:** 1. Make sure SSH is installed in both the client and the server: `sudo apt install openssh -y` 2. In the server, the SSH service must be already running, if it is not running, use this command to enable it and start it: `sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh` 3. You will need to get the IP address of the server. Use this command to get the IP address: `hostname -I`. Additionally, you can setup a static IP address in your server. Here is a guide on how to do it. If you are doing this project in your laptop, I advise to stay away from setting up static IP addresses. 4. On the client computer use this command:![ssh syntax](https://rapurl.live/7ge) ![ssh connection](/assets/ssh-with-titles.gif) 5. If you are using port forwarding, your command would be:`ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1` ### Setup private and public key authentication with or without password (optional) 1. On the server, configure the firewall to accept ssh connections. ``` sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw enable sudo ufw status ``` 2. Now we need to generate an ssh key in our client computer: In your client machine type:`ssh-keygen` Now you can type this command to copy your ssh key to the server:`ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub webmaster@server-ip-address` 3. if you use port forwarding your command will be:`ssh-copy-id -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1` 4. Now you can connect to your server without having to remember the password. ## Part 5 Setup virtual hosts Virtual host allows us to serve more than one website in a single web server. By default, Apache has one server block enabled. This server block is served from the directory: `/var/www/html`. For a single website, all the files are placed within this directory. When we setup virtual hosts, each site has its own directory. The recommendation is to leave the default `html` directory and for each site a new directory inside `/var/www`. In this project, we will have one virtual site called `myresume`. You are welcome to use a different name just remember to adjust every command where the word `myresume` is reference for your preferred website domain name. **Follow These Steps** 1. Create the directory for `myresume` as follows: `sudo mkdir /var/www/myresume` 2. Modify the ownership of `myresume` so that it is now owned by your user instead of root `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/myresume` 3. Now let's change the file permission so that the owner can read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others: `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/myresume` 4. Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called `index.html` in the `/var/www/myresume/` directory: `sudo nano /var/www/myresume/index.html`. 5. Once the new document opens, type the following text: ``` My Resume Website . ",

Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 2. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` ## Setup SSH authentication 1. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 2. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. See examle here: 3. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboad in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 4. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` You will see the following outcome: > If you do not see an error message or a different message than the one shown prior, then your SSH connection is correct.
