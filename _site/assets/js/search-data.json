Special Note 1 . This is a canonical lab for your learning. You will be making more virtual machines in the future. I suggest you create more virtual machines and then delete them. For example, find out what are the minimum requirements for installing windows 10 and then make a windows 10 virtual machine. Also, install other linux distributions as well. You do not need to keep these vms just use this lab to practice. Remember, when deleting virtual machines, make sure to select delete all files instead of just removing the vms. This will make sure that you recover your hard drive space. Special Note 2 . You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: . | git clone repository/url/here: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer | git pull: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine.

The easiest way to do this is to make sure that the network addapter in the viertual machine is set to bridge instead of nat. To do this go, open the virtual machine settings and in the network section change the adapter to Bridge. | . | However, your network may prevent you from doing this. Some IDS and smart routers may prevent you from getting an IP. In this case, you need to use port forwarding in your virtual machine. Here is a guide on how to do it. Portforwarding Example . | Make sure that the ssh server program is installed in the server virtual machine sudo apt install openssh-server -y . | Make sure that the ssh client program is installed in the client machine. This is the computer that you will be using to manage your server. sudo apt install openssh-server -y . | Enable and start ssh in the server: sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh . | Test the connection by loging in to the server from the client. First, use the ip or hostname command to find out the ip address of the server. | On the server type, hostname -I this will give you the ip address of your server. | On the client type: ssh username@server-ip-address . | If you are using port forwarding, your command will be: | . ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 . | Read and answer the questions and you will connect sucessfully. | .

    "content": "Virtual host allows us to serve more than one website in a single web server. By default, Apache has one server block enabled. This server block is served from the directory: /var/www/html. For a single website, all the files are placed within this directory. When we setup virtual hosts, each site has its own directory. The recommendation is to leave the default html directory and for each site a new directory inside /var/www. In this project, we will have one virtual site called myresume. You are welcome to use a different name just remember to adjust every command where the word myresume is reference for your preferred website domain name. Follow These Steps . | Create the directory for myresume as follows: sudo mkdir /var/www/myresume | Modify the ownership of myresume so that it is now owned by your user instead of root sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/myresume | Now let’s change the file permission so that the owner can read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others: sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/myresume | Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called index.html in the /var/www/myresume/ directory: sudo nano /var/www/myresume/index.html. | Once the new document opens, type the following text: | . &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;My Resume Website&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;This is a sample document!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . | Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER. | . NOTE: If you don’t want to use Nano, you can also do this in a single command . sudo echo \"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Resume Website&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;This is a sample document!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\" &gt; /var/www/myresume.index.html . | Now we need to create a virtual host file so that this new content can be served. The default configuration is located in /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myresume.conf | Add the following text to the domain config file: | . &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName myresume ServerAlias www.myresume DocumentRoot /var/www/myresume ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; . | Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER. | Now enable the site with the following command: sudo a2ensite myresume.conf | Now lets disable the default domain:sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf | Before we can refresh the configuration, we need to add a configuration line to the apache2.conf file. Open the file in nano:sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf | Add the following line at the end of the file:ServerName 127.0.0.1 | Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER. | Now you can test the configuration for errors:sudo apache2ctl configtest | The output of the command should look like this: | . Syntax OK . | If there are no errors, restart Apache to apply the changes:sudo systemctl restart apache2 | Now, if you open a web browser in your host computer and go the URL: http://localhost:8080/ your index.html document should load. | .

The recommendation is to leave the default html directory and for each site a new directory inside /var/www. In this project, we will have one virtual site called mywebsite. You are welcome to use a different name just remember to adjust every command where the word mywebsite is reference for your preferred website domain name. Follow These Steps . | Create the directory for mywebsite as follows: sudo mkdir /var/www/mywebsite | Modify the ownership of mywebsite so that it is now owned by your user instead of root sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/mywebsite | Now let’s change the file permission so that the owner can read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others: sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/mywebsite | Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called index.html in the /var/www/mywebsite/ directory: sudo nano /var/www/mywebsite/index.html. | Once the new document opens, type the following text: | . &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;My First Website&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;This is a sample document!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . | Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER. | . NOTE: If you don’t want to use Nano, you can also do this in a single command . sudo curl https://cis106.com/assets/basic.html -o /var/www/mywebsite/index.html . | Now we need to create a virtual host file so that this new content can be served. The default configuration is located in /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/mywebsite.conf | Add the following text to the domain config file: | . &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName mywebsite ServerAlias www.mywebsite DocumentRoot /var/www/mywebsite ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; . | Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER. | Now enable the site with the following command: sudo a2ensite mywebsite.conf | Now lets disable the default domain:sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf | Before we can refresh the configuration, we need to add a configuration line to the apache2.conf file. Open the file in nano:sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf | Add the following line at the end of the file:ServerName 127.0.0.1 | Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER. | Now you can test the configuration for errors:sudo apache2ctl configtest | The output of the command should look like this: | . Syntax OK . | If there are no errors, restart Apache to apply the changes:sudo systemctl restart apache2 | Now, if you open a web browser in your host computer and go the URL: http://ip.address.of.your.server/ your index.html document should load. | .

    "content": ". | The root directory: The first directory in the filesystem that contains the entire filesystem represented by “/”. | Current working directory: Also known as the present working directory. It is the directory where you are currently working in. You are always working from a directory. | Parent Directory: a dirtectory containing one or more directories and files. | Child directory: a better name for this is a subdirectory or subfolder. This is a directory inside another directory. See image for visual reference. | . | YOUR HOME DIRECTORY: This is your user’s personal directory where all your files are located. Every user has it’s own home directory just like in a apartment complex they all residents have their own apartment while sharing the common areas. You have total ownership of your home directory but outside of the home directory only the root user can make changes. An example absolute path, assuming that user name is maria53, would be /home/maria53 | The home Directory: This is the parent directory of all the home directories. This is where all the users’ home directory are. The absolute path of this directory is /home. Noticed that it starts at the root. | The root user: This is the administrator account of your system. To perform administrative tasks or to manage directories and files outside of your home directory, you must obtain root privileges using the sudo command at the beginning of the command. | Path name: Also known as file path. This is the location of a given file in your computer. A path name can be absolute path or relative path. | Absolute Path: The location of a file starting at the root of the file system. For example, /home/maria53/Downloads/list.txt is the absolute path of the file list.txt. The advantage of absolute paths is that they can be used at any point of the file system regardless of your current directory. Any command that is given an absolute path will be able to find the file because it will start at the beginning of the filesystem. The disadvantage is that a command can be long to type if the file path is long. | Relative Path: The location of a file starting from a child directory of the current working directory or from the current directory itself. The advantage of using relative path is that typing commands is faster. The disadvantage of relative paths is that they cannot work from anywhere in the filesystem. In order for a relative path to work, a file must be reachable from the current directory onwards. Another disadvantage of relative paths is that they require a better mental understanding of the linux filesystem in the sense that you must keep a mental image of the directory tree that you are working with. An example of a relative path would be Downloads/list.txt assuming that the current working directory is /home/maria53 Special characters: . Special characters are function like commands that tell the shell to perform a specific action without having to type the complete command. These special characters make working on the command line more efficiently. Here is short list to keep in mind. | . (single period): represents the current directory. | .. (2 consecutive periods): represents the parent directory. | ~ (tilde character): expands the current users home directory. It is like a variable that the shell uses to store the absolute path of the user’s home directory. This ~/Downloads is the same as typing /home/maria53/Downlods | / (one forward slash): as mentioned earlier, this is the root directory and the shortest path in the system. This is the beginning of the directory tree. There is nothing before it and everything after it. | - (hyphen-minus): is used to move to the previous current working directory. | # (hash or number sign): This is used for single line comments in shell scripting. | ! (single exclamation mark): used for repeating a command from the history. For example !5 will repeat the 5th command in the command history. To view the entire command history type history. | !! (2 consecutive exclamaton marks): are used for repeating the previous command. For example, !! will repeat the previous command while, sudo !! will repeat the previous command but will add sudo at the beginning of the command. This is useful for times when we forget to type sudo when performing administrative tasks. | . Bash Environment Variables . | What is a variable? . | In programming, a variable is place to store data. A variable is like a box with a label. For example, if you a lot of pens in your desk and you place them in a box a label it pens, now the box store your pens. In programming a variable can be used to store temporary or permanent information that you will continuously reuse in your program. For example, username='maria53' the variable name now stores the value maria. When evener the programs need to access the maria’s username, it can do it by referencing the variable username. | . | What is an environment variable? . | Environment variables store values of a user’s environment and can be used in commands in the shell. These values can be unique to the user’s environment which makes them ideal when writhing commands that you want to use regales of which user is using the computer. To see a list of your environment variables type env. To use the value stored in an environment variable you must prepend the variable name with a $. Here are some useful environment variables: | $USER = stores the current’s user username | $HOME = stores the absolute path of current’s user home directory | $PWD = stores the absolute path of the present working directory. | $OLDPWD = stores the absolute path of the previous current working directory | . | . Bash Tips: . | Tab Completion: autocomplete a command/pathname by pressing the tab key | Arrow keys: allows you to move, edit, and repeat commands | Ctrl + a: go to the start of the command line | Ctrl + e: go to the end of the command line . | Shortcut list | . | .
