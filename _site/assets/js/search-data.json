    "content": "![logo](/assets/logo100x100.png) # Welcome to CIS-106-Linux Fundamentals Here you will find all the information for the course. ## COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES * Demonstrate fluency in Linux terminology. * Install Linux and identify features of various distributions. * Manage files in the Linux environment. * Administer user accounts and groups efficiently. * Use Linux Utilities to manage data. * Install software and third-party utilities. * Managing Resources in the Linux networking environment. * Understanding of virtualization with Virtualbox * Understanding of Markdown and proper documentation techniques ## Technologies Learned/Used * [**Ubuntu:**](https://ubuntu.com/) is the modern, open source operating system on Linux for the enterprise server, desktop, cloud, and IoT. * [**VirtualBox:**](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. * [**Markdown:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. * [**Slack:**](https://slack.com/) is an instant messaging program designed by Slack Technologies and owned by Salesforce. * [**VS Code:**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. ## Requirements * Access to a computer where Linux can be installed. The following are options: * A virtual machine (Preferred) * A laptop/Desktop computer that you can wipe. * Access to Blackboard * A Github account * A Text editor. We will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use whatever you want * 2 Hours of study time * Capable of adjusting to fast paced course * **For virtualization** * A decent PC that meets or exceeds these requirements: * Quad-Core Processor or modern Dual-Core Processor 2.5 Ghz * 8 Gb of RAM * Windows 10/11 * 100 Gb of free space * **Knowledge of the following** * Basic components of a personal computer * Basic usage of a personal computer * Internet browsing * Reading emails * Chat Applications * Office Productivity Suites (MS Office, Google Docs, etc) * Install/Remove Software * Difference between web browser, the internet, and a search engine > Not knowing this things does not mean you will fail the course. It means that you will have to spend extra time studying. ## Advice * If you find that the content of the course is too much or that you have too many gaps in your knowledge, I suggest that you take this course after CIS 180 and CIS 116. * If you do not have a decent computer (one that can be used for virtualization) you will have a very poor experience in this course. For this reason, I have alocated a computer in the lab (H311) that you can use. You will need to contact me ahead of time so I can setup a user for you. ## Resources * **Books** * [The Linux Command Line By William Shotts](https://bit.ly/34Og1Bp) * [Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide 4th Edition](http://bit.ly/34QaA4O) * [Free Linux Magazine with good command line reference](https://bit.ly/2LY0JTW) * [Free book. wont be used but it is good to have](http://www.it-docs.net/ddata/900.pdf) * [Raspberry Models Comparison](http://bit.ly/3qrkjHb) * **Github Markdown** * [Github Markdown Syntax Cheat sheet](https://rapurl.live/11g) * [Github Markdown syntax official documentation](http://bit.ly/3pvKZpE) * [Git Cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet) * [Linux cheat sheets](https://github.com/ra559/linux_cheat_sheets/tree/main) ",

It is long but it is the core of this course. * If you do not have a computer that meets the recommended criteria, **please reach out to me and stop doing this lab.** > **NOTE!** > * If your computer does not meet the required hardware, you will have a hard time completing all the work and the final project therefore be ready for some slow downs! . ## Step 1: Enable Virtualization Before you can create virtual machines, you need to know if your computer can run virtual machines. There are a couple of steps you need to follow to find out the answer to this question: 1. Find out what hardware your computer has: 1. CPU and number of cores 2. Amount of RAM 3. Amount of Free Storage 2. If your computer does not meet the criteria below, stop this lab and get in contact with me. We may be able to find an alternative for you but this can only be done on a 1 on 1 basis. #### REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS: * **CPU**: Quad core CPU * **RAM**: 8GB or More * **Free Storage**: 60GB or more . > If you do not meet these requirements but your computer is close enough, you may be able to complete the course material. The downside is that your computer will be extremely slow. If your computer meets or exceeds the above capabilities, then you need to check if virtualization is enabled. Follow [this guide](https://rapurl.live/vaj) to know if your computer has virtualization enabled and if it does not, use the same guide to learn how to enable it. You can also use [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) to find out if your computer has virtualization enabled. > If you are having troubles enabling virtualization, let me know immediately. **DO NOT WAIT FOR THE LAST MINUTE!** This part can take time! . ## Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine Before you can create virtual machines, you need to install VirtualBox and VirtualBox Extension Pack. To download Vbox and the extension pack go to: * [Virtualbox Download Page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) * [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) . Make sure to select the right installer for your operating system: ![VirtualBox Download page](/assets/vboxdownloadpage.png) Make sure to install VirtualBox in your host computer. For Windows follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGmCwpFYi8). For macOS follow this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyx53lJyAoc) Once you have installed VirtualBox, create a virtual machine that meets these specifications: > * OS: Ubuntu 24.04 64Bits [ISO URL](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) > * HDD: 50 GB > * RAM: 4GB > * Video: 128 MB > * Audio Controller: Disabled (audio won't be needed) > * CPU: 2 Cores > * Add this to description: > * **Hostname:** cis106vm > * **User:** student name (use your blackboard username or any other username of your choice) > * **Password:** pccc > * Shared Clipboard: Enabled - Bidirectional > * Drag n' Drop: Enabled - Bidirectional ![Create VM](/assets/createVM.gif) | virtual machine settings | --------------------------------------- | ![](/assets/virtualmachinesettings.png) | . ## Step 3: Install Ubuntu Go over the presentation [\"Installing Ubuntu 24.04 in VirtualBox 7\"](https://rapurl.live/vjw). There, I have laid out every step with proper explanations. The presentation is using an earlier version of Virtualbox and Ubuntu but the differences are not very significant. I will do it in the video as well but it will benefit you to read the presentation. ## Step 4: Optimizing Ubuntu for the class ### Update and upgrade 1. Open the terminal application and type the following command: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` 2. The terminal will prompt you to type your password. Nothing will be shown to the screen as you type. 3. This may take some time depending on your internet connection and the number of available updates. ### Install Essential packages: 1. Install the curl command which will then use to download a couple of script files. `sudo apt install curl -y` 2. Use curl to download and run the following script: `essentials.sh` ```bash curl https://cis106.com/assets/scripts/essentials.sh -o essentials.sh chmod +x essentials.sh ./essentials.sh rm essentials.sh ``` 3. Install VS Code: ```bash curl https://cis106.com/assets/scripts/vscode.sh -o vscode.sh chmod +x vscode.sh ./vscode.sh rm vscode.sh ``` 4. Install Librewolf: ```bash curl https://cis106.com/assets/scripts/librewolf.sh -o libre.sh chmod +x libre.sh ./libre.sh rm libre.sh ``` 5. Install Ubuntu Restricted Extras ```bash sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons -y ``` > When you see the screen below, use the tab key to select OK, the space key instead of enter, the arrow keys to select yes and the space bar again to agree to the terms and conditions: . ### Install the guest additions for virtualbox - Option 2 1. Insert the guess additions cd 2. Open the cd in the file manager from the Favorites bar 3. Right click on an empty area of the directory and click on open terminal 4. Run these commands: ```bash sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y sudo ./VBoxLinux ``` 5. Reboot the vm. You can use the command `sudo reboot now` 6. Now your virtual machine can use the full screen and share the clipboard with your host machine . ## Step 5: Setup Git 1. Sign in to your Github account. 2. Open a terminal window and run the following commands: 3. Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 4. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` 5. Setup SSH authentication 6. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 7. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. 8. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboard in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 9. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` 10. Clone your github repository. Use these commands: `cd; git clone git@github.com:yourGithub-User-Name-Here/your-Repository-Name-Here` . ## Step 6: Install VS Code Extensions 1. Install the following extensions: * [Markdown All in One by Yu Zhang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) * [Markdown PDF by yzane](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) * [Markdown Preview Enhanced by Yiyi Wang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) * [PDF Preview by Analytic Signal Limited](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=analytic-signal.preview-pdf) * [Code Spell Checker by Street Side Software](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) . ## Step 7: Setting up Gnome Screenshot Tool Note: The default screenshot application does not work for us. However, `gnome-screenshot` gives us what we need. In the past, we used to use `flameshot`, however, it is still not supported under Wayland therefore we will move away from Flameshot for the time being. To setup Gnome-Screenshot, follow these steps: 1. Install gnome screenshot: use the following command `sudo apt install gnome-screenshot -y` 2. Open the keyboard settings in Ubuntu. 1. Settings -> Keyboard -> View Customize shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts -> Click the + icon to add a new shortcut 2. In the dialog box add the following: 1. **Name:** `gnome-screenshot` 2. **Command:** `gnome-screenshot -i` 3. Click the set screenshot button and press the print screen key in your keyboard or any other keyboard combination of your choosing. 4. Click the replace button. 5. Press the print screen key to test. Did it work? Chances are it did not. 1. *For some weird reason this does not work the first time we do it, therefore, repeat the process and make sure to spell the command correctly. See the gif for reference!* . ## Time to submit this lab 1. First, lets organize the repository 1. Open the file manager 2. Create the following folders: `labs`, `weekReports`,`finalExam`,`cheatSheets`,`notes` 3. move all the files related to lab 1 to the `labs` folder 4. Inside the lab folder create 2 folders: `lab1` and `lab2`. From this point on, every lab will have its own folder and so will every week report. 5. Move all the lab 1 files to the `lab1` folder 6. Repeat the process for the week report 1 2. Open the `cis106` folder in VS Code 3. Inside the `lab2` folder, create a file named `lab2.md` 4. Add the following markdown to the file: ``` # Lab 2 Submission ## Virtual Machine settings ![cpufetch](cpufetch.png) ![script](script.png) ``` 5. Open a terminal and run the following command: `cpufetch | pv -qL 200` or simply `cpufetch` 6. Take a screenshot of the entire terminal window. Save the screenshot in the lab2 directory inside the cis106 directory. Name the screenshot `cpufetch.png` 7. Clear the terminal with the command: `clear` and run the following command: `curl -s https://cis106.com/assets/scripts/lab2_system_info.sh | bash` 8. Take a screenshot of the entire terminal window. Save the screenshot in the lab2 directory inside the cis106 directory. Name the screenshot `script.png` 9. Save and convert the file `lab2.md` file to pdf 10. Open the vs code terminal and enter the following commands to commit and push your changes to github: ```bash git pull git add . git commit -m 'lab2 finished' git push ``` 11. In blackboard submit the following: 1. The URL to the `lab2.md` file in github 2. The `lab2.pdf` file . ### Special Note 1 This is a canonical lab for your learning. You will be making more virtual machines in the future. I suggest you create more virtual machines and then delete them. For example, find out what are the minimum requirements for installing windows 10 and then make a windows 10 virtual machine. Also, install other linux distributions as well. You do not need to keep these vms just use this lab to practice. Remember, when deleting virtual machines, make sure to select `delete all files` instead of just removing the vms. This will make sure that you recover your hard drive space. ### Special Note 2 You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: * `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer * `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code * `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. * `git commit -m \"label for your changes here\"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command * `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository > Always run the commands in this order: `pull` => `add` => `commit` => `push` > Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository!

    "content": "# {{page.title}} > Video [here](https://youtu.be/PtJMXxi1je8) ## Question 1: VS CODE 1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 2. If you find the VS Code interface complicated or too unfamiliar, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-s71n0dHUk) before you continue with the lab. ## Question 2: Github Account 1. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account using your PCCC email address. Make sure to save your github username, email, and password somewhere safe (like a password manager). *You will need it a lot!* If you already have a github account, you are allowed to use it. 2. Create a public repository called `cis106` **LOWERCASE PLEASE!** 1. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/uraJCa5V-Ao) on how to create a github account and repository. 3. Do not close the github page, you will need it later. ## Question 3: Learning Markdown 1. In your Documents folder, create a folder called `lab1` **LOWERCASE PLEASE!** 2. [Enable file extensions in Windows explorer.](https://rapurl.live/oy1) 3. Read the presentation ['What is Markdown'](https://rapurl.live/va6) 4. During this presentation you will complete several practice exercises. Make sure to place all the files inside the `lab1` folder. 5. You will need some exercise files that are reference in the presentation. Use this [URL](https://cis106.com/assets/lab1.zip) to download the zip file that contains the files. Uncompress/decompress the zip file in the `lab1` folder. This is not the same as opening the zip file. You will need to copy or move the files to the `lab1` folder. 6. Download the markdown cheat sheet before you start the challenge question. The cheat sheet can be found in the presentation . > > * *The goal of this lab is to learn and practice markdown.* > * *Please follow along in the video as I will be completing the practice there.* > * *Once you complete the practice, do the challenge question* > ## Question 4: Challenge Question **Scenario:** Your friend, John Doe, has asked you to make a 1 page resume for him. He has given you all his information in a text file and a picture for you to use. Since you have recently learned about markdown, you want to write his resume in markdown and then give him the PDF. 1. Inside the lab1 folder, create a folder called: `challenegeQuestion` *One word, no space, camel case PLEASE!* 2. Using markdown, create a 1 page resume for John Doe. Name the file `resume.md` and place it inside the `challengeQuestion` 3. Everything you need to create the markdown file was provided with the `lab1.zip` file you downloaded earlier. 4. Once the markdown file is created, convert the file to pdf. 5. [This](/assets/lab1files/resume.png) is how the PDF file should look like when you are done. **PS.** *The Preview may not look like the finish product however the image and table must render correctly!* . ## What will you upload to Github: The entire `lab1` folder. Every single file must be in your github repository! > I do this in the video so there should be no excuses. ## Submission In blackboard, submit the following: * The PDF file of `ubuntu.pdf`. This is the file your converted when you finished all the practice in this lab. * The MD file `ubuntu.md` * The md file `resume.md`. This is john doe's resume. * The pdf file `resume.pdf`. This is john doe's resume in pdf format. * The URL to your github repository . ## Here is how I will grade you: 1. I will go to your github repository, I will check that you complete all the practice from the video that is **25 points**. Having the `ubuntu.md` file complete is proof of this 2. I will check that you completed the challenge question that is **50 points**. Having the `resume.md` file properly formatted is proof of this. 3. If I cannot find the files in Github, you will not be awarded a passing grade for this lab. 4. I will check that you uploaded all the files I asked for in blackboard. This is **25 Points**. #### Late submissions will be penalized 30 points. See blackboard for due date > If you need more practice in markdown, see the [Extra Section of the page](https://cis106.com/extra/lab1_md_extra_practice/). There you will find an extra practice for this lab. We can review your work on a 1:1 meeting at the time of your choosing as long as I have availability via Zoom. ",

This lab assumes the following about your computer: * CPU: M1 or M2 * Ram: 16 GB * OS: Mac OS Sonnoma Latest version This lab assumes the following about you: * You can follow instructions * You have basic understanding of your computer's hardware ## Step 1: Download Hypervisor Download the following applications: * [UTM Hypervisor for M series Macs](https://mac.getutm.app/) * [Ubuntu Server For ARM ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm) 1. Install UTM. 2. Do not touch/open/mount the Ubuntu ISO file. ## Step 2: Create the virtual machine Create a virtual machine for Ubuntu Server 1. Launch UTM. Select \"Create a New Virtual Machine\" 2. Here you will have 2 options. 1. **Emulate**: This is for x86_64. This option is slower but it will give you the same version of Ubuntu that the Windows users virtualize in Virtualbox. We will not be using this option on Mac. 2. **Virtualize**: this is for ARM64 operating system like the Ubuntu Server ISO we downloaded earlier. Most of the software we are going to use is available for ARM so there should not be much difference in the Labs for you 3. Select \"**Virtualize**\" 4. Select \"**Linux**\" for the Operating System options 5. In the \"**Boot ISO Image**\" section, click on the browser button and select the Ubuntu Server ISO you downloaded earlier. 6. In the \"**Hardware**\" configuration window, select the following: 1. RAM: 4096 MB 2. CPU Cores: 2 3. **Note**: *We won't be using OpenGL hardware acceleration for now, but if you start having graphics issues, enable this feature and see if it helps. This is an experimental feature so for now let's keep it safe. * 7. In the \"**Storage**\" section, set the disk size to 50Gb. That is just enough for our class. If you want to give it more storage, you can. 8. In the \"**Shared Directory**\" section, keep the defaults as is. We will not be needing a shared directory. But if you want to have a shared directory between then Host (mac) and Guest(Ubuntu), go ahead and play around with it. I leave this up to you. There are tons of guides on how to do this. 9. In the \"**Summary**\" Section, set the **Name** to Ubuntu Desktop 1. The Virtual Machine settings window will open. 2. Add the following in the notes: 1. **Hostname**: cis106 2. **username**: your blackboard username - or a preferred username 3. **password**: pccc (*we are going to keep things simple to help troubleshooting*) ## Step 3: Install Ubuntu Server 1. Start the VM by pressing the **Play** button 2. If you see a message screen that reads \"**Display Output is not active**\" ignore it. The VM is just starting 3. Follow the steps to install Ubuntu server as laid out in the guides: [How to install Ubuntu Server 24.04](https://cis106.com/guides/install-ubuntu-server-20.04/) > **Notes**: > 1. We will install the Server Edition of Ubuntu. The server does not have a graphical installer but it is easy anyways. > 2. Later we will install a graphical desktop environment 4. Once the OS has been installed, reboot the VM. If the VM seems to be hanging, manually reboot it. Before the disk boots the installer again, turn off the VM. 5. Remove the Ubuntu Server ISO file from the virtual DVD Drive. 6. Turn on the Virtual Machine and sign in. Use your username and password you set during the installation process ## Step 4: Update the system and install a desktop environment Run these commands one at the time: ```bash sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop -y sudo reboot now ``` > **Note**: We will be using Gnome but you are welcome to use any other desktop environment. This will install Ubuntu's spin of the Gnome Desktop environment. A lot of packages will be installed, so this step will take time Now that you have a desktop environment, let's configure the rest of the system: 1. Do not enable Ubuntu Pro 2. Ignore any error reporting. We will disable this anyway 3. Some users have reported issues with full screen so if you are having issues, just don't use full screen. 4. Open a terminal window. Type this command to disable animations: `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false` 5. Remove the error reporting software and other applications we won't need: `sudo apt purge apport aisleriot gnome-mahjongg gnome-sudoku ` ## Step 5: Install essential software 1. Install the curl command which will then use to download a couple of script files. `sudo apt install curl -y` 2. Use curl to download and run the following script: `essentials.sh` ```bash curl https://cis106.com/assets/scripts/essentials.sh -o essentials.sh chmod +x essentials.sh ./essentials.sh rm essentials.sh ``` 3. Install VS Code: ```bash curl https://cis106.com/assets/scripts/vscode.sh -o vscode.sh chmod +x vscode.sh ./vscode.sh rm vscode.sh ``` 4. Install Ubuntu Restricted Extras ```bash sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons -y ``` > When you see the screen below, use the tab key to select OK, the space key instead of enter, the arrow keys to select yes and the space bar again to agree to the terms and conditions: . ## Step 6: Setting up Gnome Screenshot Tool Note: The default screenshot application does not work for us.

Did it work? Chances are it did not. 1. *For some weird reason this does not work the first time we do it, therefore, repeat the process and make sure to spell the command correctly. See the gif for reference!* . ## Step 7: Setup VS Code Install the following extensions: * [Markdown All in One by Yu Zhang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) * [Markdown by starkwang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkwang.markdown) * [Markdown PDF by yzane](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) * [Markdown Preview Enhanced by Yiyi Wang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) * [PDF Preview by Analytic Signal Limited](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=analytic-signal.preview-pdf) * [Code Spell Checker by Street Side Software](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) ## Step 8: Setup Git and Github 1. Sign in to your Github account. 2. Open a terminal window and run the following commands: 3. Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 4. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` 5. Setup SSH authentication 6. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 7. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. 8. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboard in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 9. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` 10. Clone your github repository. Use these commands: `cd; git clone git@github.com:yourGithub-User-Name-Here/your-Repository-Name-Here` . ## Time to submit this lab 1. First, lets organize the repository 1. Open the file manager 2. Create the following folders: `labs`, `weekReports`,`finalExam`,`cheatSheets`,`notes` 3. move all the files related to lab 1 to the `labs` folder 4. Inside the lab folder create 2 folders: `lab1` and `lab2`. From this point on, every lab will have its own folder and so will every week report. 5. Move all the lab 1 files to the `lab1` folder 6. Repeat the process for the week report 1 2. Open the `cis106` folder in VS Code 3. Inside the `lab2` folder, create a file named `lab2.md` 4. Add the following markdown to the file: ``` # Lab 2 Submission ## Virtual Machine settings ![cpufetch](cpufetch.png) ![script](script.png) ``` 5. Open a terminal and run the following command: `cpufetch | pv -qL 200` or simply `cpufetch` 6. Take a screenshot of the entire terminal window. Save the screenshot in the lab2 directory inside the cis106 directory. Name the screenshot `cpufetch.png` 7. Clear the terminal with the command: `clear` and run the following command: `curl -s https://cis106.com/assets/scripts/lab2_system_info.sh | bash` 8. Take a screenshot of the entire terminal window. Save the screenshot in the lab2 directory inside the cis106 directory. Name the screenshot `script.png` 9. Save and convert the file `lab2.md` file to pdf 10. Open the vs code terminal and enter the following commands to commit and push your changes to github: ```bash git pull git add . git commit -m 'lab2 finished' git push ``` 11. In blackboard submit the following: 1. The URL to the `lab2.md` file in github 2. The `lab2.pdf` file . ## Known issues: * Markdown PDF converter does not work: * **Solution**: Install Chromium-browser: `sudo apt install chromium-browser` * Open the extensions settings: * Navigate to the executable path and type: `/snap/bin/chromium` * If the machine freezes at this step, reboot and force close the Virtual Machine and UTM. * Ghosting when typing in the VS Code integrated Terminal: * **Workaround**: * Open a regular terminal * Navigate to the cis106 directory: `cd cis106` * Run the git commands from there: * `git pull` * `git add .` * `git commit -m \"changes\"` * `git push` * **Note**: I have not found a real solution for this yet. ## Special Note You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: * `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer * `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code * `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. * `git commit -m \"label for your changes here\"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command * `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository > Always run the commands in this order: `pull` => `add` => `commit` => `push` > Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository!

Open the file manager and navigate to the `labs` folder/directory inside the cis106 repository `(~/cis106/labs/)` 2. Create a folder/directory called `lab3` 3. Open VS Code and open the `cis106` directory/folder inside VS Code 4. Create a file called `lab3.md` inside the `lab3` folder/directory 5. Add the following markdown, save the file, close vs code, and start your lab . ``` --- Student: your name semester: Spring 24 Assignment: Lab 3 --- # Lab 3 Submission ## Question 2 ![q2](q2.1.png) ## Question 3 ![q3](q3.png) ## Challenge Question ![q4](q4.png) ## Script Source code: [lab3](lab3-script.sh) ``` . ## Question 1: Using Ubuntu's Desktop Environment (GNOME) ### Appearance 1. Download a wallpaper that you like. You can use this website for downloading wallpapers: [wallheaven.cc](https://wallhaven.cc/) 2. Create a directory/folder in the `Pictures` directory called `wallpapers` 3. Save the file in this newly created directory. Make sure to change the name to something more descriptive of the image. 4. Right-click on the desktop and change the wallpaper to the one you downloaded recently. 5. Add the following applications to the favorites bar: 1. VS Code 2. Tilix 6. Customize the favorites bar to your liking 1. Change its position 2. Remove any application you do not use regularly 3. Do you like the panel mode or the dock mode? 4. How about the icon size? . ### Custom Font 1. Download one of the following fonts from this [website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads): 1. Hack 2. FiraCode 3. Meslo 4. Source Code Pro 5. Terminus 6. Monoid 7. Noto 8. Iosevka **Note**: you can use this [website](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#fira) to preview the font. Choose one you like and download it. 2. Install the font 1. Create a hidden folder/directory in your home directory called `.fonts` (In Linux, hidden folders start with a period therefore to create a hidden folder all you need to do is start its name with a period) 2. Enable hidden folder view in the file manager by pressing CTRL + H. You should notice that a lot of more hidden folders appear. 3. Decompress the `font.zip` file you downloaded earlier and move all the `.ttf` files to the `.fonts` directory. 4. Open a terminal and type the command `fc-cache -fv`. This command will scan your system for new fonts. 3. Close the terminal. Open the file manager and press CTRL + H again so we can hide the hidden folders/directories again. *You don't want to mistakenly delete those later!* 3. Open the terminal and type the following command: `echo \"hello world\"` . #### This question does no require screenshot . ## Question 2: Working with BASH in the terminal emulator > **Note:** I use tilix but you are welcome to use any other terminal emulator. 1. Open **Tilix** and then click on the hamburger menu (≡) and then on preference. Ignore the error message 2. Click on appearance. Enable “**Use a wide handle for splitters**” 3. Split the terminal in 2 horizontally. Open the man page of the `echo` command in one of the terminals. 4. Resize the terminal window so that you have enough space to work on both. 5. Using the man page of echo figure out how to do the following: * Display a line of text without the new line * Display a line of text that includes a horizontal tab * Display 2 lines of text in a single echo command * Display 2 lines of text in a single echo command, with the second line starting with a tab * Display 2 lines of text in a single echo command that starts with a tab . #### Take a screenshot of the terminal showing all the commands that you used and the man page open. Save your screenshot as q2.1.png ## Question 3: Write a basic shell script 1. Open the text editor app (Gnome Text) 2. Click on the gear icon (⚙) then 1. Enable \"**Show line numbers**\" 2. Enable \"**Show right margin**\" 3. disable \"**Check spelling**\" 4. In Spaces Per Tab, set it to \"**4**\" 3. Click on the hamburger menu (≡) and then properties 1. Pick a a theme that you like 2. Enable custom font and pick the font you downloaded earlier. Adjust the font size to your liking. 3. Enable highlight current line 4. Type the following line: `#!/bin/bash` (double-check your spelling) 5. Save the file as: `lab3-script1.sh` in the `lab3` folder/directory inside `cis106/labs/` . 6. Add the following lines, then save the script. ```bash echo \"This is a shell script,\" echo -n \"This script will print the current date\" date echo \"This is the machine's name:\" uname -n echo \"This is the current user:\" echo $USER echo \"This is the current date\" date +\"%A, %B %d %R %Z\" ``` 7. Add the following comments at the top after the shell declaration/shebang `#!/bin/bash` ```bash # Author: your name # Date: current date in format mm/dd/yy # Description: This is a basic script that # uses environment variables and the date command ``` 8. Save the script and close the text editor 9. Open a terminal and type the following commands to execute the script: `bash ~/cis106/labs/lab3/lab3-script.sh` . #### Take a screenshot of the terminal showing the output of the script. Double-check your spelling and follow every step correctly if you get any error messages. ## Question 4: Challenge Question Write a shell script that displays the following output: ![cqo](/assets/lab3/challenngeQoutput1.png) ### Tips: * You will need to read the man page of the `echo`, `uname`, and `date`, `df`, `free` and `figlet` commands. * You can use the `cheat` command * Save the script in the same directory/folder as you saved the question 3 script `~/cis106/labs/lab3/` * Name the script `challenge_lab3.sh` * The command to run the script is `bash ~/cis106/labs/lab3/challenge_lab3.sh` if this does not work, it is because you saved the script in the wrong folder. *Retrace your steps to troubleshoot.* * You must complete this question alone. I cannot provide assistance here. Everything you need to complete this challenge has been covered in this lab and in the [presentations](https://bit.ly/3jS8fNa). While I cannot provide you with assistance answering the question, I can provide extra explanations or clarifications. > **NOTE**: This script must use the `echo`, `uname`, and `date`, `df`, `free` and `figlet` command. Any other solution that does not involve these commands will not be accepted and you will receive 0 for this question. No exceptions! ## What will you submit: 1. Place and properly label (using headings) all the screenshots you took. See the markdown I gave you at the beginning of this document 2. Convert the file to pdf 3. Push everything to github 4. In Blackboard, submit the pdf file `lab3.pdf` **Note**: I will read your script from github. If the script is not there, you will not receive credit. ## How I will grade you: * I will navigate to your GitHub repository and read your script. * I will download your script and run it on my machine. * If your script runs and I get the same output as the screenshot, you will get full credit for the challenge question. Otherwise, partial credit will be awarded. * Every question in this lab is worth 25 points. ## Special Note You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: * `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer * `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code * `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. * `git commit -m \"label for your changes here\"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command * `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository > Always run the commands in this order: `pull` => `add` => `commit` => `push` > **Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository!** ",

Here are the rules: * ***YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE CD!*** * You can create more than 1 directory at the same time * You can only use **relative path** for all the directory and file names * All the commands must be run from your home directory (**$HOME**) ```bash lab5/ └── q1.1 └── games ├── action │   └── action_games.txt ├── fps │   └── fps_list.txt └── rpg └── mods.py 5 directories, 3 files ``` * To complete this question, follow these instructions: 1. Create a Directory in **YOUR home directory ($HOME)** labeled: `lab5`. 2. Inside `lab5` create the directory `q1.1` and the subdirectory `games`. Inside `games`, create the subdirectory `action`. You must use the `-p` option of the `mkdir` command. Then, inside `games`, create the remaining 2 subdirectories. `-p` is not necessary here anymore because the parents directory already exist. 3. Inside each respective directory, create the text files: `action_games.txt`,`fps_list.txt`, and `mods.py` 4. Use the `tree` command to list the `lab5` directory. Alternatively, you can use `ls -R` for a recursive list of the `lab5` directory. > **Take a screenshot of the terminal only.

The goal is to create a slide show that can show different images when the user clicks the next and previous button. He has sent you the code that makes the website. Your job is to test it to make sure it works. To download the site use this command: ```bash cd $HOME && wget https://cis106.com/assets/lab5/website-lab5.zip && unzip website-lab5.zip && rm website-lab5.zip ``` This will create the following directory: `~/website-lab5`. That contains `index.html`. **There is no need to edit this file**. If you open the site, you will notice that the site is just a black screen. That is because the directory `website-lab5` is missing 3 image files that you need to test it. Here are the steps to complete this challenge: 1. Use the given command in the problem description to download the directory and file. (`website-lab5/index.html`) 2. Download 3 images from [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/search/HD%20wallpaper/). Make sure the images are horizontal and the file format is jpg 3. Rename and move the images using the following naming convention. You have to rename and move using 1 command. This part should take 3 commands because there are only 3 files. 1. old_name1.jpg -> img1.jpg 2. old_name2.jpg -> img2.jpg 3. old_name3.jpg -> img3.jpg 4. List the `website-lab5` directory. It should look like this: . 5. Open the `index.html` file in firefox and take a screenshot. Test the slideshow by clicking the next and previous buttons. The images you downloaded should be shown there. > Take a screenshot of the commands you used to answer this question and of firefox showing the index.html file open. ## What will you Submit: * Place all the screenshots and answers to your questions in a the `lab5.md` file. Label each question submission correctly using headings. * Convert your markdown file to pdf * Push the changes to Github: `git pull; git add .; git commit -m \"lab5 complete; git push\"` * Submit the URL of `Lab5.md` and the pdf file * If you are using virtualbox, this will be a good time to take a snapshot. ## How will you be graded: * You will lose points if you do not include the full screenshot of firefox. I need to see the complete firefox window showing the URL. * You will lose points if you use more than 3 mv commands to get the job done. * The value of each question is: 20pts ### Special Note You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: * `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer * `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code * `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. * `git commit -m \"label for your changes here\"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command * `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository > Always run the commands in this order: `pull` => `add` => `commit` => `push` > **Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository!** ",

They can be confusing but once you get a hold of them, you will never forget them. The table above gives you a summary of each wildcard. The goal of this lab is to give you enough practice for you to master wildcards in their basics form. Wildcards are very powerful because they can be combined to match pretty much any pattern that you can think of. ## IMPORTANT!!! READ ME!!!!! > Before working on this lab, run this command: **`curl https://cis106.com/assets/lab6.sh | bash`** This will create a directory called `lab6` in your home directory . ## Question 1 | Using the * Wildcard > In your home directory, you should have a directory called `lab6`, if you don't have it, make sure to run the curl command in the `READ ME` part of this lab. 1. List all the `log` files located in the `lab6` directory. 2. Create a directory called `log-files` inside the `lab6` directory. Move all the log files to the `log-files` directory. 3. List all the configuration files in the `etc` directory. (*Configuration files have the extension of .conf*) 4. Long list all the configuration files in the `etc` directory that start with letter `h` or letter `p` **sorted by file size**. Modify the ls command with the proper options so that the output looks like this: (*Notice the date*) ``` -rw-r--r-- 1 7.5K 08/19/21 /etc/pnm2ppa.conf ``` > You can see a full list of control characters for the date [here](https://cis106.com/guides/format-control-char-date-command/) **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . ## Question 2 | Using the ? wildcard 1. List only the hidden files inside the `lab6` directory. 2. List all the files with a 2 letter file extension in the `lab6` directory 3. Inside the `lab6` directory, list all the files that start with letter `l`, have one character after letter `l`, and the letters `st`. The the rest of the file name is irrelevant. 4. Inside the `lab6` directory, list all the files that have an `_` and two characters before the file extension. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . ## Question 3 | Using the [] Wildcard 1. List all the files that start with an uppercase letter 2. List all the files that start with an uppercase letter or a number 3. List all the files that have a number in the file name 4. List all the files that start with a lowercase letter and have a number before the file extension. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . ## Question 4 | Using brace expansion. The curly braces are not a wildcard but they are equally useful. The curly braces allow you to generate arbitrary strings to use with commands. **Problem 1:** In the `lab6` directory, create the following directory structure. Display a tree of the directory. **Take a screenshot**: ``` wallpapers/ └── cars ├── 1080p ├── 2k └── 4k ``` **Problem 2:** Clear your terminal. in the `lab6` directory, create the following directory structure. Display a tree of the directory. **Take a screenshot**: ``` assets/ ├── imgs │   ├── large │   └── small └── video ├── large └── small ``` **Problem 3:** Clear your terminal. in the `lab6` directory, create the following directory structure. You need to create the pdf files as well. Remember mkdir creates directories while touch creates files. Display a tree of the directory. **Take a screenshot**: ``` docs/ └── books ├── history │   ├── fall │   │   └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) │   └── spring │   └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) └── math ├── fall │   └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) └── spring └── book.pdf (this is a file not a directory) ``` **Problem 4:** Brace expansion comes handy in other scenarios too. Here are some examples: 1. Create a directory in your home directory called `lab6-q5`. From the root of the filesystem create 3 files in the lab6-q5 directory called: `program.py`, `people.csv`, `data.xls`. 2. Change your current working directory to `/usr/share`. Create a directory in the `lab6-q5` directory called `movies`. Create 3 files in the `~/lab6-q5/movies` directory called `movies.lst`, `marvel.txt` and `disney.doc`. 3. Remove the files: `program.py`, `people.csv`, `disney.doc`, and `marvel.txt`. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** . # Challenge Question > Run this curl command: **`curl https://cis106.com/assets/lab6cq.sh | bash`** This will create a directory in your home directory called: `challenge-Lab6` This directory has a bunch of files. Organize these file so that each file type has its own directory. Each file type must be moved to its respective directory. When you are done, the `challenge-Lab6` directory should look like this: ``` challenge-lab6/ ├── audio │   ├── aac │   │   └── all-aac-files-here │   └── mp3 │   └── all-mp3-files-here ├── docs │   ├── docx │   │   └── all-docs-files-here │   ├── pdf │   │   └── all-pdf-files-here │   └── xls │   └── all-xls-files-here └── images ├── jpg │   └── all-jpg-files-here └── png └── all-png-files-here ``` > Note: The directory tree you see here is just an example, you may or may not have the same files. *Tips* * Try to create your directory structure in a single command. * Try working with multiple terminal windows open. * List all the files in the directory sorted by file extensions to understand which directories you need to create. **Take a screenshot of your terminal showing all the commands that you used to complete this question.** ## What will you Submit: * Place all the screenshots and answers to your questions in a the `lab6.md` file. * Convert your markdown file to pdf * Push the changes to Github: `git pull; git add .; git commit -m \"lab5 complete; git push\"` * Submit the URL of `lab6.md` and the pdf file * Take a snapshot of your system and delete the previous snapshot. ### Special Note You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: * `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer * `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code * `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. * `git commit -m \"label for your changes here\"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command * `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository > Always run the commands in this order: `pull` => `add` => `commit` => `push` > **Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository!** ",

The easiest way to do this is to make sure that the network addapter in the viertual machine is set to bridge instead of nat. To do this go, open the virtual machine settings and in the network section change the adapter to Bridge. ![network adapter](/assets/networkadapter.png) * However, your network may prevent you from doing this. Some IDS and smart routers may prevent you from getting an IP. In this case, you need to use [port forwarding](https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding) in your virtual machine. Here is a [guide](shorturl.at/ckHR8) on how to do it. ### Portforwarding Example ![portforwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) * Make sure that the ssh server program is installed in the server virtual machine ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` * Make sure that the ssh client program is installed in the client machine. This is the computer that you will be using to manage your server. ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` * Enable and start ssh in the server: ``` sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh ``` * Test the connection by loging in to the server from the client. First, use the ip or hostname command to find out the ip address of the server. * On the server type, `hostname -I` this will give you the ip address of your server. * On the client type: ``` ssh username@server-ip-address ``` * If you are using port forwarding, your command will be: ``` ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 ``` * Read and answer the questions and you will connect sucessfully. ## Setup private and public key authentication with or without password: * On the server, configure the firewall to accept ssh connections. ``` sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw enable sudo ufw status ``` * Now we need to generate an ssh key in our client computer. If you are using your ubuntu machine from the course, then you already have one. If you are not, then you must create the ssh keys: * In your client machine type: ``` ssh-keygen ``` * Now you can type this command to copy your ssh key to the server ``` ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub webmaster@server-ip-address ``` * if you are using port forwarding, use this command instead: ``` ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 2222 webmaster@127.0.0.1 ``` > if you use port forwarding your command will be: ``` ssh-copy-id -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 ``` * Now you can connect to your server without having to remember the password.

Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 2. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` ## Setup SSH authentication 1. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 2. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. See examle here: 3. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboad in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 4. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` You will see the following outcome: > If you do not see an error message or a different message than the one shown prior, then your SSH connection is correct. Now you can push and clone using SSH. ",

    "content": "# {{page.title}} ## Video: * [Here](https://youtu.be/SgeB_8EgAMk) ## Synopsis Make Gedit feel and look more like an IDE than a text editor ## What is Gedit Gedit is a text editor designed for the GNOME desktop environment. It was GNOME's default text editor and part of the GNOME Core Applications until GNOME version 42 in March 2022, which changed the default text editor to GNOME Text Editor. ## How to install Gedit If you are using Gnome, gedit is installed by default. This is the default text editor for Gnome. To install gedit: `sudo apt install gedit gedit-plugins -y` If you are using gnome, install the plugins package otherwise the plugins won't be available. Gnome Text Editor and gedit are essentially the same app. ## Installing and using plugins 1. Open gedit (text editor) and go to preferences > Plugins 2. Enable the following plugins: 1. **Bracket Autocompletion**: will auto close brackets, parenthesis, and quotes 2. **Code Comment**: will allow us to do multi line commenting. (CTRL + M and CTRL + Shift + M) 3. **Embedded terminal**: Will give us a quick terminal at the bottom of the gedit window. 4. **File Browser Panel**: Will give us a file manager to the left of the window. 5. **Multi Edit**: will give us multi line editing. 6. **Open Links**: will allow us to open URLs 7. **Quick highlight**: Will automatically highlight all instances of the highlighted word 8. **Quick open**: with CTRL + Alt + o ,opens a menu to open recently edited files 9. **Session Saver**: saves the session so when you close gedit and open it again, it opens on the last session 10. **Text Size**: will us to increase or decrease the size of the text using CTRL + and CTRL - 11. **Word completion**: Will enable autocomplete of common words in the script . ## Enabling functionality 1. In the view tab of the preferences window enable the following: 1. Display line numbers 2. Display right margin at column 80 3. Display overview map 4. **In the editor tab:** 1. Set the tab width to 4 spaces 2. Autosave the file every 5 minutes . 2. In the Font and color: 1. Download the font [Firacode Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/FiraMono.zip) 2. Install the font 1. Extract the archive in a the directory `.fonts` located in YOUR home directory. If the directory is not there, press CTRL + H to enable hidden files. If the directory is not there still, create it. 2. Open a terminal and type the command: `fc-cache -f -v` to refresh the font cache. 3. Go back to gedit Font & Colors tab inside preferences. 4. Change the font to **FiraMono Nerd Font Mono Regular** (if you cant find the font, close gedit and open it again) . 3. Changing the theme 1. Optional (change the font size to a size you are more comfortable with) 2. Optional (change the color scheme to something you prefer or matches our preference). I like the dracula theme which you can download from [here](https://draculatheme.com/gedit) 3. Here are [other themes](/assets/geditThemes/themes.tar.xz) you can download too! 4. You will need to place these themes in: `$HOME/.local/share/gedit/styles/` 5. Themes are xml files so you need to extract the xz file in that directory. 4. In the view options of the hamburger menu, enable: 1. Side Panel 2. Bottom Panel . ## Testing Gedit Here is the source code: ### Bash ```bash #!/bin/bash main (){ echo \"Hello world\" } main ``` ### HTML ```html Say hello! ",

Check if virtualization is supported using the commands: `egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo`This command should return any number greater than 0 2. Install cpu checker: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install cpu-checker` 3. Check if your system supports KVM `sudo kvm-ok` This should return the following output: ``` INFO: /dev/kvm exists KVM acceleration can be used ``` ## Step 2 1. Install KVM and other dependencies: `sudo apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager` 2. Enable the virtualization daemon: `sudo systemctl status libvirtd` 3. Check if the kvm modules are running: `lsmod | grep -i kvm` 4. This should return the following output (similar): ``` kvm_amd 208896 0 kvm 1417216 1 kvm_amd ccp 155648 4 kvm_amd ``` 5. Add your user to the necessary groups. This will allow qemu to use iso files: `sudo usermod -aG libvirt-qemu $USER` and `sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER` 6. You can make virtual machines with virt-manager now. The process is similar to Virtualbox. 7. If you get an error message in virt-manager that reads: `QEMU/KVM - Not Connected`, reboot. ## Pending on this guide: 1. Add steps to create virtual machines graphically and via the command line 2. Add steps to export virtual machines 3. Add steps to create snapshopts and install spice tools ",

You will be installing Ubuntu Server in a virtual machine and managing the server from another computer. That computer can be your Host Machine (Windows) or the Ubuntu Desktop virtual machine that we use in the course. The project will give you basic/initial exposure to the following technologies: * Virtualization (VirtualBox) * Ubuntu Server * Apache * SSH * HTML * Markdown * VS Code The project is divided into 3 deliverables. It is done this way, so you can work slowly through the semester as you gain more knowledge working with Ubuntu Desktop. This also allows you to earn a grade as the semester progresses because the final grade is divided equally among the 3 deliverables. The final project is 20% of your final grade, however, this can change, therefore do not skip any deliverable! Each deliverable will be submitted as a Markdown document in your GitHub Repository. You will also be required to submit a PDF version of each deliverable, just in case something happens to your GitHub Repository. No late submission will be accepted. This project is due on Dec 21st. ## Requirements * A virtual machine/PC where you can install Ubuntu Server. A Virtual machine will be preferred since everything in the tutorials will be done in a virtual machine. This is the main tutorial we will follow: * [How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 22.04](https://rapurl.live/ch3) Here are some sources you can use to investigate: * [What is a Web Server](https://rapurl.live/pbe) * [What is SSH](https://rapurl.live/9bg) * [What is Ubuntu Server](https://rapurl.live/57a) * [Open Source Web Servers](https://rapurl.live/pkm) ## Deliverable 1: Project's Requirements > **Old Video with more details is available [here](https://youtu.be/F0DdCC5Lq3A)** > **Newer and shorter video is available [here](https://youtu.be/CYasEYqKq-s)** > **[Image resize tool](https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/upload) > **Example of how the deliverable should look like [here](https://rapurl.live/5d8)** For **deliverable 1**, we are going to accomplish the following tasks: 1. Read the tutorial. Write down every concept you don't understand and research them. 2. Answer The following questions: * What is a web server? Hardware and software side * What are some different web server applications? * What is virtualization? * What is virtualbox? * What is a virtual machine? * What is Ubuntu Server? * What is a firewall? * What is SSH? To demonstrate the completion of deliverable 1, the student needs to submit a markdown and pdf file where all the questions are answered. Here you can find an example of how the document should look like. ## Deliverable 2 Installing Ubuntu Server And Apache > *Video:[Deliverable 2 Latest Video 0-100!](https://youtu.be/6L0OXwMT-tg) ### Resources: * [Apache Commands You Should know](https://linuxize.com/post/apache-commands-you-should-know/) * [IP Command With Examples](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-ip-command-examples-usage-syntax/) * [UFW Essentials](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands) * [How To Troubleshoot Common Apache Errors](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-troubleshoot-common-apache-errors) Follow this guide to install Ubuntu Server and Apache.

The default configuration is located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myresume.conf` 8. Add the following text to the domain config file: ``` ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName myresume ServerAlias www.myresume DocumentRoot /var/www/myresume ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ``` 9.

This will update the Ubuntu installer and proceed with the installation. ### Step 4 ![Step 4](/assets/step-4-keyboard-select.png) This step will automatically select the language layout of your keyboard. If for whatever reason it is different than what your physical keyboard has, then manually adjust it. ### Step 5 ![Step 5](/assets/Step-5-install-type.png) Choose the default Ubuntu Server installation. We will need some of the repositories in the default installation. ### Step 6 ![Step 6](/assets/step-6-ip-address.png) Since we are installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine that at the moment is configured to have a NAT network interface card, as long as your host PC has internet connection, you should automatically get an IP address. If you don't, something is wrong with your VM, Host Machine, or Internet Connection. > Note: If you are doing this project in the school's network, be aware that the school's routers are configured to block Bridged Ethernet adapters. ### Step 7 ![Step 7](/assets/step-7-proxy.png) Leave this part empty as we are not using a proxy. ### Step 8 ![step 8](/assets/step-8-mirror.png) We will use the default mirror so there is no need to change this ### Step 9 ![Step 9](/assets/step-9-disk.png) This step is to format our disk. Here we will select the entire disk. To move around here use either the arrow keys or the tab key. ### Step 10 ![Step 10](/assets/step-10-confirm-disk.png) ![Step 10.1](/assets/step-10-1-confirm-disk.png) This step is just to let you know the changes that will be made to the server's virtual hard drive. ### Step 11 ![Step 11](/assets/step-11-server-info.png) Here you will enter the information about your computer. Write this information down because you will needed it later. ### Step 12 ![Step 12](/assets/step-12-ssh.png) It is a good idea to install ssh now as we will use it later on. Do not import SSH keys. We will do that manually later. ### Step 13 ![Step 13](/assets/step-13-services.png) Do not select these services. We won't be using them. ### Step 14 ![Step 14](/assets/step-14-installation.png) This is the installation process. Once it is done it will start updating the system. Once the update is done, it will ask you to reboot. ### Step 15 ![Step 15](/assets/step-15-reboot-now.png) ### Step 16 ![Step 16](/assets/step-16-press-enter.png) Here Just press enter. Virtualbox will unmount the installation disk for you ## Part 3 Install Apache First, login to the server. You will need to type your username and password. Here is an example: ![log in](/assets/loging-in-ubuntu-server.gif) Notice that the password is hidden while typing just like when you are typing it in the terminal emulator. Be aware that during the upgrade, Ubuntu will ask you to restart some services. Apache is available in Ubuntu's default repositories. However, before we can start installing new packages, let's update the system: ``` sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y ``` ![Update Ubuntu](/assets/update-ubuntu-server.gif) To install Apache use: ``` sudo apt install apache2 -y ``` ![install apache](/assets/install-apache.gif) Be aware that here you will also need to restart some services here. ## Part 4 Setup SSH #### Before Setup Before we can setup SSH, we need to enable the firewall. Use this command: ``` sudo ufw enable ``` Now lets configure ufw to allow Apache and SSH traffic: ``` sudo ufw allow 'Apache' sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH' ``` Now check the status of the firewall: ``` sudo ufw status ``` ![firewall](/assets/firewallcheck.gif) Now lets check the status of Apache and SSH to make sure they are running: ``` systemctl status apache2 --no-pager systemctl status ssh --no-pager ``` Both commands should return `active (running)` if they do not, restart the services with the command: ``` sudo systemctl restart apache2 ssh ``` ![service status check](/assets/service-status-check.gif) #### Setup Port forwarding 1. Turn off the server virtual machine if it is on. 2. Go to the network virtual machine configuration for the server. There add port forwarding to the NAT configuration. You will need to forward port 22 to 2222 and port 80 t0 8080. Here is a screenshot: ![Port forwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) 3. Turn on the server. Make sure that the ssh server program is installed in the server virtual machine: ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` 4. Enable and start ssh in the server: ``` sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh ``` 5. Test the connection by logging in to the server from the client. In this case, your client is your Host computer terminal application (in Windows, it is the CMD or powershell) ``` ssh -p 2222 username_of_the_server@127.0.0.1 ``` 6. Read and answer the questions and you will connect sucessfully. ## Part 5 Setup virtual hosts Virtual host allows us to serve more than one website in a single web server. By default, Apache has one server block enabled. This server block is served from the directory: `/var/www/html`. For a single website, all the files are placed within this directory. When we setup virtual hosts, each site has its own directory. The recommendation is to leave the default `html` directory and for each site a new directory inside `/var/www`. In this project, we will have one virtual site called `myresume`. You are welcome to use a different name just remember to adjust every command where the word `myresume` is reference for your preferred website domain name. **Follow These Steps** 1. Create the directory for `myresume` as follows: `sudo mkdir /var/www/myresume` 2. Modify the ownership of `myresume` so that it is now owned by your user instead of root `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/myresume` 3. Now let's change the file permission so that the owner can read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others: `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/myresume` 4. Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called `index.html` in the `/var/www/myresume/` directory: `sudo nano /var/www/myresume/index.html`. 5. Once the new document opens, type the following text: ``` My Resume Website . ",

You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. > **NOTE:** > If you don't want to use Nano, you can also do this in a single command ``` sudo curl https://cis106.com/assets/basic.html -o /var/www/mywebsite/index.html ``` . ![setup virtual host 1](/assets/setup-virtual-host-1.gif) 7. Now we need to create a virtual host file so that this new content can be served. The default configuration is located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/mywebsite.conf` 8. Add the following text to the domain config file: ``` ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName mywebsite ServerAlias www.mywebsite DocumentRoot /var/www/mywebsite ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ``` 9. Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. 10. Now enable the site with the following command: `sudo a2ensite mywebsite.conf` 11. Now lets disable the default domain:`sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf` 12. Before we can refresh the configuration, we need to add a configuration line to the `apache2.conf` file. Open the file in nano:`sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf` 13. Add the following line at the end of the file:`ServerName 127.0.0.1` 14. Save and close the file when you are finished.

Turn off the server virtual machine using this command: `sudo shutdown now` 2. Change the server network adapter configuration from NAT to Bridge. ![Network Adapter](/assets/networkadapter.png) >However, there is a chance that using a bridge adapter won't work for you. Some IDS (Instruction Detection Systems) and smart routers may prevent you from getting an Ip Address if your Network Adapter is bridge. In this case, you need to use [port forwarding](https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding) in your virtual machine. Here is an example: ![portforwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) ### Connect with SSH ![ssh connection](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTQha8cbvbsKtr6D7fqbP3CZ64F9sFTVqWpxEwvpJfg5VymCf5a6rutXUkzd3R3CTFSS9JXBt4BmOU-/pub?w=502&h=200) **Follow these steps:** 1. Make sure SSH is installed in both the client and the server: `sudo apt install openssh -y` 2. In the server, the SSH service must be already running, if it is not running, use this command to enable it and start it: `sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh` 3. You will need to get the IP address of the server. Use this command to get the IP address: `hostname -I`. Additionally, you can setup a static IP address in your server. Here is a guide on how to do it. If you are doing this project in your laptop, I advise to stay away from setting up static IP addresses. 4. On the client computer use this command:![ssh syntax](https://rapurl.live/7ge) ![ssh connection](/assets/ssh-with-titles.gif) 5. If you are using port forwarding, your command would be:`ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1` ### Setup private and public key authentication with or without password (optional) 1. On the server, configure the firewall to accept ssh connections. ``` sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw enable sudo ufw status ``` 2. Now we need to generate an ssh key in our client computer: In your client machine type:`ssh-keygen` Now you can type this command to copy your ssh key to the server:`ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub webmaster@server-ip-address` 3. if you use port forwarding your command will be:`ssh-copy-id -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1` 4. Now you can connect to your server without having to remember the password. ## Part 5 Setup virtual hosts Virtual host allows us to serve more than one website in a single web server. By default, Apache has one server block enabled. This server block is served from the directory: `/var/www/html`. For a single website, all the files are placed within this directory. When we setup virtual hosts, each site has its own directory. The recommendation is to leave the default `html` directory and for each site a new directory inside `/var/www`. In this project, we will have one virtual site called `mywebsite`. You are welcome to use a different name just remember to adjust every command where the word `mywebsite` is reference for your preferred website domain name. **Follow These Steps** 1. Create the directory for `mywebsite` as follows: `sudo mkdir /var/www/mywebsite` 2.

Now let's change the file permission so that the owner can read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others: `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/mywebsite` 4. Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called `index.html` in the `/var/www/mywebsite/` directory: `sudo nano /var/www/mywebsite/index.html`. 5. Once the new document opens, type the following text: ``` My First Website . ",

We user `cd ../` when we want to navigate the the directory above the current directory. Say that your current working directory is `/home/student/Downloads/Games/`Doom/ and you want to go to /home/student/Downloads/Games. In this instance the `cd ../ `command will take you there. The 2 dots indicate the parent directory of the current working directory. You can use it to navigate to more than 1 parent directory for example, if we want to go to /home/student, we would use `cd ../../../` . Notice that in this instance we only moved up in the directory tree. ## cd - cd - is used to move between 2 directories. These are the current directory and the previous current directory. Linux has 2 environment variables to keep track of this information; `$OLDPWD` and $PWD. Every time you use the cd command these 2 variables get updated to reflect the current information. So if your current working directory is `/home/student/Downloads/Games/Doom` and you use cd to change to `/usr/share/themes` then the current value of those variables would be: * **OLDPWD**=home/student/Downloads/Games/Doom * **PWD**=/usr/share/themes Now, if you use the `cd -` command, then bash will change directories to the value in `$OLDPWD` and update the variables accordingly. So the values now are: * **OLDPWD**=/usr/share/themes * **PWD**=home/student/Downloads/Games/Doom . ## When should I use cd -? Well that depends on your workflow and what you are doing at the moment. Since we can switch between 2 directories without typing the path, this comes handy in the following essenarios: 1. If you are working in two directories and need to switch between them frequently, and the path is long and you don't want to type all of that. 2. If you are editing files in different directories using a command-line 3. If you are working in a temporary directory you can switch back and forward between the temp directory and the current directory 4. If you are writing script that requires you to move from 2 directories, cd - allows you to do that without storing the paths in variables. ## When should I use cd ../? All the time honestly! typing .. is quicker than typing a path backwards. So whenever you need to switch back to the parent directory, use this instead! ## Then what's up with .. and .? A single dot (.), represents the current directory where the 2 dots, as mentioned earlier represents the parent directory. This means that: * `ls .` and `ls` do the same thing because by default ls will list the current directory. * `cd .` will do nothing because it will try to change directory to the current directory. And you cannot go into a room that you are already in! However, there are legit uses for the single dot (.) For example, when you want to copy a file from one directory the current directory: * `cp ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/wall.png ./` Or when writing paths to files in the current directory in markdown: * `![wall](./wall.png)` .

Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 2. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` ## Setup SSH authentication 1. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 2. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. See examle here: 3. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboad in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 4. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` You will see the following outcome: > If you do not see an error message or a different message than the one shown prior, then your SSH connection is correct.

Mkdir can make 1 or multiple directories by separating each directory name with a space. ### Formula/usage `mkdir` + `option` + `directory names` ***Where directory name can be:*** * Just the name of the directory if you want to create them in the current working directory * `Absolute` or `relative` path if you want to create the directory in a different location ### Examples * **Using relative path**: Create a directory in your current working directory called `games` * `mkdir games` * **Using relative path:** Create 3 directories inside the games directories called: `action`, `adventure`,`fps` * `mkdir games/action games/adventure games/fps` * **Using absolute path:** Create a directory in the action directory called `wonderboy` * `mkdir ~/games/action/wonderboy` * **Using absolute path:** Create 2 directories, one in `fps` and another in `adventure`. Call them `cod` and `uncharted` * `mkdir ~/games/fps/cod ~/games/adventure/uncharted` * Create a parent and subdirectory at the same time * `mkdir -p ~/Documents/school/english/homework` * Create a directory and display a message confirming the directory creation (verbose output) * `mkdir -pv ~/Downloads/games` * `mkdir -pv ~/Downloads/games/action games/fps/doom practice` . ### Practice #### Description You have just been assigned the task of organizing a new project called \"ProjectPhoenix\" on your company's server. For this project, you need to set up a directory structure that will hold various types of documents. The structure should look like this: ```bash ProjectDelta/ ├── planning/ │  ├── meetings/ │ └── drafts/ ├── development/ │ ├── code/ │ └── documentation/ └── testing/ ├── unit_tests/ └── integration_tests/ ``` #### Solution Show Solution . ## TOUCH ### Description `touch` is used to create an empty file or to update the timestamp of an existing file. If the specified file does not exist, touch will create it. If the file exists, touch will update its access and modification times to the current time. ### Formula/usage * `touch` + `option` + `file(s) name` ***Where file name can be:*** * Just the name of the files if you want to create them in the current working directory * `Absolute` or `relative` path if you want to create the directory in a different location ### Examples * Create multiple files in the current working working directory * `touch notes.txt program.py page.html` * Create multiple files in different directories using **absolute path** * `touch ~/games/action/wonderboy/run.txt ~/games/adventure/uncharted/todo.md` * Create multiple files in different directories using **relative path** * `touch games/action/run.sh games/fps/readme.md` . ### Practice #### Description In th previous practice, you created a directory structure. Add the following files to each directory: ```bash ProjectDelta/ ├── development │   ├── code │   │   ├── app.js │   │   ├── index.html │   │   └── styles.css │   └── documentation │   └── readme.md ├── planning │   ├── drafts │   │   └── notes.md │   └── meetings │   └── schedule.docx └── testing ├── integration_tests │   └── instructions.md └── unit_tests └── test.js 10 directories, 8 files ``` #### Solution Show Solution . ## RM ### Description The `rm` command is used to remove files and directories. It is a powerful command that can **permanently delete files**, so it should be used with caution. By default, rm removes files, but with certain options, it can also delete directories and their contents. In Linux, only empty directories can be removed. When you try to remove non-empty directories the following error is shown: \"`rm: cannot remove 'directory_name/': Is a directory`\". Even when using the `rmdir` command, trying to remove a non empty directory results in the following error: \"`rmdir: failed to remove 'directory_name/': Directory not empty`\". To remove directories use the `-r` option. See examples. ### Formula/usage * `rm` + `option` + `directories or files to remove` ***Where file/directory name can be:*** * Just the name of the files/directories if they are located in the current working directory * `Absolute` or `relative` path if they are located in a different location **Common Options:** * `-f`: Force removal without prompting for confirmation. * `-r` or `-R`: Recursively remove directories and their contents. * `-i`: Prompt before each removal. * `-v`: Verbose mode, showing the files as they are removed. ### Examples * Remove files using absolute path * `rm ~/games/action/run.sh ~/games/adventure/uncharted/todo.md` * Remove files using relative path * `rm games/fps/readme.md games/notes.txt games/page.html` * Remove files and directories but prompt for confirmation before removing and display removal message when done * `rm -vir games/program.py ~/ProjectDelta` * Remove a non empty directory forcing the removal * `rm -rf games/` . ### Practice You have a folder named \"`OutdatedProjects`\" in your home directory. This folder contains old project files that you no longer need, including subdirectories with their own files. You want to clean up your home directory by completely removing the \"`OutdatedProjects`\" folder and all of its contents. The directory structure looks like this: ```bash /home/user/OutdatedProjects/ ├── projectA/ │ └── old_data.txt ├── projectB/ │ └── old_report.txt ├── projectC/ │ └── notes.txt └── archived_files.txt ``` Use the `rm` command to delete the entire \"`OutdatedProjects`\" directory, including all of its subdirectories and files, using an absolute path. Before you can run the rm command, you will need to create the directories. Run this command that will run a script to generate the directories and files for you. ```bash curl https://cis106.com/assets/extra/rm_practice.sh | bash ``` [script](../assets/extras/) ## MV ### Description ### Formula/usage ### Examples ### Practice ## CP ### Description ### Formula/usage ### Examples ### Practice ",

It is the directory where you are currently working in. You are always working from a directory. * **Parent Directory:** a dirtectory containing one or more directories and files. * **Child directory:** a better name for this is a subdirectory or subfolder. This is a directory inside another directory. See image for visual reference. * **YOUR HOME DIRECTORY:** This is your user's personal directory where all your files are located. Every user has it's own home directory just like in a apartment complex they all residents have their own apartment while sharing the common areas. You have total ownership of your home directory but outside of the home directory only the root user can make changes. An example absolute path, assuming that user name is maria53, would be `/home/maria53` * **The home Directory:** This is the parent directory of all the home directories. This is where all the users' home directory are. The absolute path of this directory is `/home`. Noticed that it starts at the root. * **The root user:** This is the administrator account of your system. To perform administrative tasks or to manage directories and files outside of your home directory, you must obtain root privileges using the `sudo` command at the beginning of the command. * **Path name:** Also known as file path. This is the location of a given file in your computer. A path name can be absolute path or relative path. * **Absolute Path:** The location of a file starting at the root of the file system. For example, `/home/maria53/Downloads/list.txt` is the absolute path of the file `list.txt`. The advantage of absolute paths is that they can be used at any point of the file system regardless of your current directory. Any command that is given an absolute path will be able to find the file because it will start at the beginning of the filesystem. The disadvantage is that a command can be long to type if the file path is long. * **Relative Path:** The location of a file starting from a child directory of the current working directory or from the current directory itself. The advantage of using relative path is that typing commands is faster. The disadvantage of relative paths is that they cannot work from anywhere in the filesystem. In order for a relative path to work, a file must be reachable from the current directory onwards. Another disadvantage of relative paths is that they require a better mental understanding of the linux filesystem in the sense that you must keep a mental image of the directory tree that you are working with. An example of a relative path would be `Downloads/list.txt` assuming that the current working directory is `/home/maria53` ### Special characters: Special characters are function like commands that tell the shell to perform a specific action without having to type the complete command. These special characters make working on the command line more efficiently. Here is short list to keep in mind. * **. (single period):** represents the current directory. * **.. (2 consecutive periods):** represents the parent directory. * **~ (tilde character):** expands the current users home directory. It is like a variable that the shell uses to store the absolute path of the user's home directory. This `~/Downloads` is the same as typing `/home/maria53/Downlods` * **/ (one forward slash):** as mentioned earlier, this is the root directory and the shortest path in the system. This is the beginning of the directory tree. There is nothing before it and everything after it. * **- (hyphen-minus):** is used to move to the previous current working directory. * **# (hash or number sign):** This is used for single line comments in shell scripting. * **! (single exclamation mark):** used for repeating a command from the history. For example `!5` will repeat the 5th command in the command history. To view the entire command history type `history`. * **!! (2 consecutive exclamaton marks):** are used for repeating the previous command. For example, `!!` will repeat the previous command while, `sudo !!` will repeat the previous command but will add `sudo` at the beginning of the command. This is useful for times when we forget to type sudo when performing administrative tasks. ### Bash Environment Variables * **What is a variable?** * In programming, a variable is place to store data. A variable is like a box with a label. For example, if you a lot of pens in your desk and you place them in a box a label it pens, now the box store your pens. In programming a variable can be used to store temporary or permanent information that you will continuously reuse in your program. For example, `username='maria53'` the variable name now stores the value `maria`. When evener the programs need to access the maria's username, it can do it by referencing the variable `username`. * **What is an environment variable?** * Environment variables store values of a user's environment and can be used in commands in the shell. These values can be unique to the user's environment which makes them ideal when writhing commands that you want to use regales of which user is using the computer. To see a list of your environment variables type `env`. To use the value stored in an environment variable you must prepend the variable name with a `$`. Here are some useful environment variables: * **$USER** = stores the current's user username * **$HOME** = stores the absolute path of current's user home directory * **$PWD** = stores the absolute path of the present working directory. * **$OLDPWD** = stores the absolute path of the previous current working directory ### Bash Tips: * **Tab Completion**: autocomplete a command/pathname by pressing the tab key * **Arrow keys**: allows you to move, edit, and repeat commands * **Ctrl + a**: go to the start of the command line * **Ctrl + e**: go to the end of the command line * [Shortcut list](https://skorks.com/2009/09/bash-shortcuts-for-maximum-productivity/ ) . ## Commands to navigate the linux filesystem To navigate the linux filesystem, you only need to master 3 commands: `cd`, `pwd` and `ls`. While there are other useful commands, those can be considered complimentary and you should learn them after you have mastered those 3. ### PWD * **Usage** * Displays the absolute path of the current working directory. * **Formula** * `pwd` * **Examples** * Print the absolute path of current working directory * `pwd` . ### CD * **Usage** * Changes the current working directory. In other words, it moves you from one directory to another. By default, it will always send you to your home directory. * **Formula** * `cd` + `destination absolute path or relative path` * **Examples** * Go (change your current directory) to your home directory (there is more than 1 way of doing this): * `cd` (without any arguments, cd will take you home) * `cd ~` (using the ~ special character. as ~ will expand to the absolute path of the user's home directory) * `cd $HOME` (using the $HOME environment variable) * `cd /home/$USER/Downloads` (using $USER environment variable in the path) * Go to a specified directory with absolute path: * `cd /usr/share/themes` * Go to a specified directory with relative path assuming your current working directory is `/home` * `cd maria53/Downloads/` * Go to the previous working directory. This is useful when you are working with 2 directories located far in the directory tree * `cd -` * Go to the previous directory in the directory tree. One directory above. * `cd ../` * Go to 2 directories above the directory tree * `cd ../../` . ### Practice CD command: Try to complete these tasks without looking at the solution. Use the image below as a reference: . 1. Using absolute path, go to the directory \"`/user/share/themes/Adwaita`\" 2. Go back to your home directory. 3. Go back to the \"`/user/share/themes/Adwaita`\" using the - special character. 4. Go to the root of the filesystem using the \"`..`\" special character. 5. Go to your \"`Downloads`\" directory 1 directory at the time. Display/Print your present working directory once you have reached the \"`Downloads`\" directory. 6. Go back to your home directory and then to the \"`Pictures`\" directory. Show Solution . ### LS * **Usage** * ls is used for listing files and directories. By default it will list the current directory when no directory is specified. Listing means to see what is inside a directory. * **Formula** * `ls` + `option` + `directory to list` * **Examples** * See all the options of the ls command (extracted from the man page): * `ls --help` * List the current directory: * `ls` * List all the files including hidden files in current directory: * `ls -A` * List all the files inside a given directory: * `ls -A /usr/share/fonts/X11` (absolute path) * `ls -A Documents/` (relative path assuming that the $PWD is $HOME) * Long list a directory * `ls -lA ~/Pictures` * List a directory recursively * `ls -R Documents/` * Long list a directory only * `ls -ld Documents/` * List a directory sorted by last modified * `ls -t Documents/` * List a directory sorted by file size * `ls -S Documents/` * Long list a directory excluding group and owner information, with human readable file size and sorted in reverse order. * `ls -lhgGr Documents/` #### Output of LS -L explained: . ### Practice LS command: Try to complete these tasks without looking at the solution. 1. Use this command to download some example files: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ra559/cis106/main/assets/scripts/practice_ls.sh | bash` 2. The command above will create a directory in your home directory called `practicels` Here you will find 10 example files to practice ls. If the command above did not work, read the output carefully and try to fix it yourself. You can also download the zip file on your own. Read the basic script for the URL. 1. list all the files in the practice directory. 2. long list all the files in the practice directory. 3. long list all the files in the practice directory sorted by file size with human readable file sizes 4. long list all the files in the practice directory sorted by file size with human readable file sizes and in reverse order. 5. long list all the files in the practice directory without the group and owner, with human readable file sizes, sorted by file extension and with full time stamp. Show Solution . ### Tree * **Usage** * used to display a recursive directory listing (tree) of files. * **Formula** * `tree` + `option` + `directory` * **Examples** * Display a tree of the home directory * `tree ~` or `tree $HOME` or `tree /home/$USER` * Display a tree of a directory with file permissions * `tree -p ~/practicels` * Display a tree of a directory with the full path prefix, with the user and group owner, human readable file sizes, and the date of last modified. * `tree -pughD ~/practicels/` . ### EXA * **Usage** * Used the same way as ls. To list files and directories. Exa is a modern replacement for ls written in Rust. Exa is not installed by default. You will need to install it using your linux distribution package manager. * **Formula** * `exa` + `option` + `directory` * **Examples** * list all files in a given directory in a single line * `exa -1 ~/practicels` * long list all the files in a given directory * `exa -l ~/practicels` * long list all the files in a given directory with headers * `exa -lh ~/practicels` * list a directory in a tree like format * `exa -T ~/practicels` .
