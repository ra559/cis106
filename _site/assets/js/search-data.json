    "content": "![logo](/assets/logo100x100.png) # Welcome to CIS-106-Linux Fundamentals Here you will find all the information for the course. ## COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES * Demonstrate fluency in Linux terminology. * Install Linux and identify features of various distributions. * Manage files in the Linux environment. * Administer user accounts and groups efficiently. * Use Linux Utilities to manage data. * Install software and third-party utilities. * Managing Resources in the Linux networking environment. * Understanding of virtualization with Virtualbox * Understanding of Markdown and proper documentation techniques ## Technologies Learned/Used * [**Ubuntu:**](https://ubuntu.com/) is the modern, open source operating system on Linux for the enterprise server, desktop, cloud, and IoT. * [**VirtualBox:**](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. * [**Markdown:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. * [**Slack:**](https://slack.com/) is an instant messaging program designed by Slack Technologies and owned by Salesforce. * [**VS Code:**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. ## Requirements * Access to a computer where Linux can be installed. The following are options: * A virtual machine (Preferred) * A laptop/Desktop computer that you can wipe. * Access to Blackboard * A Github account * A Text editor. We will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use whatever you want * 2 Hours of study time * Capable of adjusting to fast paced course * **For virtualization** * A decent PC that meets or exceeds these requirements: * Quad-Core Processor or modern Dual-Core Processor 2.5 Ghz * 8 Gb of RAM * Windows 10/11 * 100 Gb of free space * **Knowledge of the following** * Basic components of a personal computer * Basic usage of a personal computer * Internet browsing * Reading emails * Chat Applications * Office Productivity Suites (MS Office, Google Docs, etc) * Install/Remove Software * Difference between web browser, the internet, and a search engine > Not knowing this things does not mean you will fail the course. It means that you will have to spend extra time studying. ## Advice * If you find that the content of the course is too much or that you have too many gaps in your knowledge, I suggest that you take this course after CIS 180 and CIS 116. * If you do not have a decent computer (one that can be used for virtualization) you will have a very poor experience in this course. For this reason, I have alocated a computer in the lab (H311) that you can use. You will need to contact me ahead of time so I can setup a user for you. ## Resources * **Books** * [The Linux Command Line By William Shotts](https://bit.ly/34Og1Bp) * [Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide 4th Edition](http://bit.ly/34QaA4O) * [Free Linux Magazine with good command line reference](https://bit.ly/2LY0JTW) * [Free book. wont be used but it is good to have](http://www.it-docs.net/ddata/900.pdf) * [Raspberry Models Comparison](http://bit.ly/3qrkjHb) * **Github Markdown** * [Github Markdown Syntax Cheat sheet](https://rapurl.live/11g) * [Github Markdown syntax official documentation](http://bit.ly/3pvKZpE) * [Git Cheat sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet) * [Linux cheat sheets](https://github.com/ra559/linux_cheat_sheets/tree/main) ",

    "content": "Before you can create virtual machines, you need to know if your computer can virtualize. There are a couple of steps you need to follow to find out the answer to this question: . MacOS users . | For those using MacOS, if you have a recent Apple computer (M1/M2 CPU), you will not be able to use Virtualbox, there is another hypervisor you can use but I have not been able to test it since I do not own a Mac. Other students have used it in the past and they say that, aside from some workarounds, it works fine. You can watch and follow this tutorial. Again, I have not tested this option therefore you are on your own. From past semester experience, I cannot recommend MacOS with M1/M2 Macs for users who lack sufficient understanding of how to use their computer. The experience is very poor and students have encountered too many problems at the level where they cannot complete the work on time. Proceed at your own risk . | If you have an older Mac (Intel Version), you can use virtualbox as it is fully supported. Just make sure your Mac has enough resources to run virtual machines. For intel Macs, virtualization is already enabled so move along to step 2 . | . Windows Users . Follow these steps: . | Find out what hardware your computer has: . | CPU and number of cores | Amount of RAM | Amount of Free Storage | . | If your computer does not meet the criteria below, stop this lab and get in contact with me. We may be able to find an alternative for you but this can only be done on a 1 on 1 basis. | . REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS: . | CPU: Quad core CPU | RAM: 8GB or More | Free Storage: 60GB or more | . If you do not meet these requirements but your computer is close enough, you may be able to complete the course material. The downside is that your computer will be extremely slow. If your computer meets or exceeds the above capabilities, then you need to check if virtualization is enabled. Follow this guide to know if your computer has virtualization enabled and if it does not, use the same guide to learn how to enable it. You can also use Speccy to find out if your computer has virtualization enabled. If you are having troubles enabling virtualization, let me know immediately. DO NOT WAIT FOR THE LAST MINUTE!

Special Note 1 . This is a canonical lab for your learning. You will be making more virtual machines in the future. I suggest you create more virtual machines and then delete them. For example, find out what are the minimum requirements for installing windows 10 and then make a windows 10 virtual machine. Also, install other linux distributions as well. You do not need to keep these vms just use this lab to practice. Remember, when deleting virtual machines, make sure to select delete all files instead of just removing the vms. This will make sure that you recover your hard drive space. Special Note 2 . You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: . | git clone repository/url/here: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer | git pull: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code | git add .: to track all the changes made to your file. | git commit -m \"label for your changes here\": this command will label all the changes you added with the add command | git push: will send all your changes to your github repository | . Always run the commands in this order: pull =&gt; add =&gt; commit =&gt; push Never use the github website to make changes to your repository unless you know what you are doing and can remember to pull the changes before working on your local repository! .

If you find the VS Code interface complicated or too unfamiliar, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-s71n0dHUk) before you continue with the lab. ## Question 2: Github Account 1. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account using your PCCC email address. Make sure to save this password. *You will need it a lot!* If you already have a github account, you are allowed to use it. 2. Create a public repository called `cis106` **LOWERCASE PLEASE!** 1. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/uraJCa5V-Ao) on how to create a github account and repository. 3. Do not close the github page, you will need it later. ## Question 3: Learning Markdown 1. In your Documents folder, create a folder called `lab1` **LOWERCASE PLEASE!** 2. [Enable file extensions in Windows explorer.](https://rapurl.live/oy1) 3. Read the presentation ['What is Markdown'](https://rapurl.live/va6) 4. During this presentation you will complete several practice exercises. Make sure to place all the files inside the `lab1` folder. 5. You will need some exercise files that are reference in the presentation. Use this [URL](https://cis106.com/assets/lab1.zip) to download the zip file that contains the files. Uncompress the zip file in the `lab1` folder 6. Download the markdown cheat cheat before you start the challenge question. * The goal of this lab is to learn and practice markdown. * Please follow along in the video as I will be completing the practice there. * Once you complete the practice, do the challenge question ## Question 4: Challenge Question **Scenario:** Your friend, John Doe, has asked you to make a 1 page resume for him. He has given you all his information in a text file and a picture for you to use. Since you have recently learned about markdown, you want to write his resume in markdown and then give him the PDF. 1. Inside the lab1 folder, create a folder called: `challenegeQuestion` *One word, no space, camel case PLEASE!* 2. Using markdown, create a 1 page resume for John Doe. Name the file `resume.md` and place it inside the `challengeQuestion` 3. Everything you need to create the markdown file was provided with the `lab1.zip` file you downloaded earlier. 4. Once the markdown file is created, convert the file to pdf. 5. [This](/assets/lab1files/resume.png) is how the PDF file should look like when you are done. PS. The Preview may not look like the finish product however the image and table must render correctly! . ## What will you upload to Github: The entire lab1 folder. Every single file must be in your github repository! > I do this in the video so there should be no excuses. ## Submission In blackboard, submit the following: * The PDF file of ubuntu.pdf. This is the file your converted when you finished all the practice in this lab. * The MD file ubuntu.md * The md file resume.md. This is john doe's resume. * The pdf file resume.pdf. This is john doe's resume in pdf format. * The URL to your github repository . ## Here is how I will grade you: 1. I will go to your github repository, I will check that you complete all the practice from the video that is 25 points. Having the ubuntu.md file complete is proof of this 2. I will check that you completed the challenge question that is 50 points. Having the resume.md file properly formatted is proof of this. 3. If I cannot find the files in Github, you will not be awarded a passing grade for this lab. 4. I will check that you uploaded all the files I asked for in blackboard. This is 25 Points. #### Late submissions will be penalized 30 points. See blackboard for due date > If you need more practice in markdown, see the Extra Section of the page. There you will find an extra practice for this lab. ",

It will give you an idea of what we are trying to do here. * Please go slow and take your time to do this lab. It is long but it is the core of this course. * If you do not have a computer that meets the recommended criteria, **please reach out to me and stop doing this lab.** * Be aware that the presentations use an earlier version of Ubuntu but the changes are not that significant and you should be able to follow along. > **NOTE!** > * Only start this lab after you have watched the videos or read the presentations. > * If your computer does not meet the required hardware, you will have a hard time completing all the work and the final project therefore be ready for some slow downs! ## Question 1 | Enable virtualization Before you can create virtual machines, you need to know if your computer can virtualize. There are a couple of steps you need to follow to find out the answer to this question: ### MacOS users * For those using MacOS, if you have a recent Apple computer (M1 CPU), you will not be able to use Virtualbox, there is another hypervisor you can use but I have not been able to test it since I do not own an M1 Mac where I can test it. You can watch and follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnwK-nkXolc). Again, I have not tested this option therefore you are on your own. > ***from past semester experience, I cannot recommend MacOS with M1 CPUs. The experience is very poor and students have encountered too many problems at the level where they cannot complete the work on time. Proceed at your own risk*** * If you have an older Mac (Inter Version), you can use virtualbox as it is fully supported. Just make sure your Mac has enough resources to run virtual machines. For intel Macs, virtualization is already enabled and you can just follow this guide/video. ### Windows Users Follow these steps: 1. Find out what hardware your computer has: 1. CPU and number of cores 2. Amount of RAM 3. Amount of Free Storage 2. If your computer does not meet the criteria below, stop this lab and get in contact with me. We may be able to find an alternative for you but this can only be done on a 1 on 1 basis. **REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS:** - CPU: Quad core CPU - RAM: 8GB or More - Free Storage: 60GB or more . > If you do not meet these requirements but your computer is close enough, you may be able to complete the course material. The downside is that your computer will be extremely slow. If your computer meets or exceeds the above capabilities, then you need to check if virtualization is enabled. Follow [this guide](https://rapurl.live/vaj) to know if your computer has virtualization enabled and if it does not, use the same guide to learn how to enable it. You can also use [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) to find out if your computer has virtualization enabled. If you are having troubles enabling virtualization, let me know immediately. **DO NOT WAIT FOR THE LAST MINUTE!** This part can take time! Take a screenshot showing your computer specifications and a screenshot of the task manager showing virtualization has been enabled. MacOS user should only take a screenshot of the computer specs. Here is an example: | Computer specs | Virtualization | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ![specs](/assets/windowsspecs.jpeg) | ![virt](/assets/taskmanagervirtenabled.png) | . ## Question 2 | Create a Virtual Machine Before you can create virtual machines, you need to install VirtualBox and VirtualBox Extension Pack. To download Vbox and the extension pack go to: * [Virtualbox Download Page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) * [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) Make sure to select the right installer for your operating system: ![VirtualBox Download page](/assets/vboxdownloadpage.png) Make sure to install VirtualBox in your host computer. For Windows follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGmCwpFYi8). For macOS follow this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyx53lJyAoc) Once you have installed VirtualBox, create a virtual machine that meets these specifications: > * OS: Ubuntu 22.04 64Bits [ISO URL](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) > * HDD: 40 GB > * RAM: 2GB > * Video: 64 MB or Higher > * Audio Controller: Disabled (audio won't be needed) > * CPU: 2 Cores > * Add this to description: > * **Hostname:** cis106vm > * **User:** student name (use your blackboard username) > * **Password:** pccc > * Shared Clipboard: Enabled - Bidirectional > * Drag n' Drop: Enabled - Bidirectional ![Create VM](/assets/createVM.gif) > Take a screenshot of your virtual machine settings. You screenshot must show all the settings of your VM. Here is a proper example: | virtual machine settings | --------------------------------------- | ![](/assets/virtualmachinesettings.png) | . ## Question 3 | Install Ubuntu 22.04 * Go over the presentation [\"Installing Ubuntu 20.04 in VirtualBox\"](https://shorturl.at/hlor0). There, I have laid out every step with proper explanations. The presentation is using an earlier version of Virtualbox and Ubuntu but the differences are not very significant. I will do it in the video as well but it will benefit you to read the presentation. > Take a screenshot of the last screen before rebooting Ubuntu. If you missed it, take a screenshot of the welcome message or the desktop on first boot. ## Question 4 | Post Installation Tasks These are the tasks that you need to complete before taking the screenshots: * Update and upgrade * Add canonical partners in the software settings * Set update daily reminder to never * Change Wayland for X.org * Take snapshot. * Install the guest additions for virtualbox. * Run this command: `sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y` * Use this [video](https://youtu.be/IuqJxbYuU-Y) to install guest additions. * Reboot the VM * Go Full Screen * Disable animations. Run this command on your terminal: `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false` * Turn your virtual machine off > Take a screenshot of your virtual machine showing the snapshot. Here is an example: ![vm snapshot](/assets/snapshot.png) . ## Question 5 | Complete the following tasks 1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and then Install all the extensions of VS Code * [Live Server by Ritwick Dey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&ssr=false#review-details) * [Markdown All in one by Yu Zhang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one&ssr=false#review-details) * [Markdown Preview Enhanced by Yiyi Wang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) * [Markdown PDF by yzane](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf&ssr=false#review-details) * [PDF Preview by Analytic Signal Limited](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=analytic-signal.preview-pdf) * [Code Spell Checker by Street Side Software](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) 2. Using the terminal, remove all unnecessary applications from Ubuntu 22.04. Use this command: ``` sudo apt purge apport aisleriot gnome-mahjongg gnome-sudoku gnome-mines -y ``` 3. Using the software center install the following applications: * flameshot * vlc * deluge * geany * tilix > In the terminal you can use this command: `sudo apt install flameshot vlc deluge geany tilix -y` 4. Using the terminal install the following applications: gcc make perl nemo git python3-pip gnome-tweaks curl snapd flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak gnome-software-plugin-snap wget tree htop net-tools vim neofetch caffeine samba smbclient cifs-utils. You can use the following commands: * `sudo apt install gcc make perl nemo git python3-pip -y` * `sudo apt install curl wget tree htop net-tools vim -y` * `sudo apt install neofetch caffeine samba smbclient gnome-tweaks -y` * `sudo apt install snapd flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak gnome-software-plugin-snap -y` * `sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons -y` 5. Replace the default screenshot tool with flameshot. ### Setup Git and download your repository to your Ubuntu machine. 1. Sign in to your Github account. 2. Open a terminal and run the following commands: 3. Set your username: `git config --global user.name 'your username here'` 4. Set your email address: `git config --global user.email 'your email here'` 5. Setup SSH authentication 6. Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 7. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. 8. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboard in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 9. Test you ssh connection by using this command: `ssh -T git@github.com` 10. Clone your github repository. Use these commands: `cd; git clone git@github.com:yourGithub-User-Name-Here/your-Repository-Name-Here` 11. Open a file manager and go to the repository you cloned (the folder) and organize the files as I do in the video. 12. Open VS Code and open your repository folder. 13. Open a terminal in VS Code and run the following commands: `git add .; git commit -m \"Files organized\"; git push` 14. Open your github repository and your web browser and noticed how the files are now organized as they are in your computer. ## Time to submit this lab. * Inside your repository folder, create a new folder called `lab2` * Copy the screenshots you took from your windows computer to your vm by dragging and dropping the files in the newly created `lab2` folder * Place those files in a folder called: `lab2` * Inside the lab2 folder create a new file named: `lab2.md` * Open your repository in VS code and complete the document `lab2.md` with your screenshots * Save the file. * Convert the file to PDF. * Commit and push the changes to github. Use this command: `git add .; git commit -m \"Lab2 finished\"; git push` ## What will you Submit: * The URL to the lab2.md file and a pdf file of lab2. * Turn off your Virtual Machine properly. Avoid closing the Virtual Machine Window as this can break the virtual machine. * Take a snapshot of your virtual machine. ### Special Note 1 This is a canonical lab for your learning. You will be making more virtual machines in the future. I suggest you create more virtual machines and then delete them. For example, find out what are the minimum requirements for installing windows 10 and then make a windows 10 virtual machine. Also, install other linux distributions as well. You do not need to keep these vms just use this lab to practice. Remember, when deleting virtual machines, make sure to select `delete all files` instead of just removing the vms. This will make sure that you recover your hard drive space. ### Special Note 2 You are going to be using the git commands a lot. Here is a quick reference: * `git clone repository/url/here`: is the command to clone a repository where cloning means downloading a repository to your computer * `git pull`: to pull/synchronize your repository from github to your local machine. Always run this command BEFORE you start working VS Code * `git add .`: to track all the changes made to your file. * `git commit -m \"label for your changes here\"`: this command will label all the changes you added with the `add` command * `git push`: will send all your changes to your github repository > Always run the commands in this order: `pull` => `add` => `commit` => `push` ",

The easiest way to do this is to make sure that the network addapter in the viertual machine is set to bridge instead of nat. To do this go, open the virtual machine settings and in the network section change the adapter to Bridge. ![network adapter](/assets/networkadapter.png) * However, your network may prevent you from doing this. Some IDS and smart routers may prevent you from getting an IP. In this case, you need to use [port forwarding](https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding) in your virtual machine. Here is a [guide](shorturl.at/ckHR8) on how to do it. ### Portforwarding Example ![portforwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) * Make sure that the ssh server program is installed in the server virtual machine ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` * Make sure that the ssh client program is installed in the client machine. This is the computer that you will be using to manage your server. ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` * Enable and start ssh in the server: ``` sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh ``` * Test the connection by loging in to the server from the client. First, use the ip or hostname command to find out the ip address of the server. * On the server type, `hostname -I` this will give you the ip address of your server. * On the client type: ``` ssh username@server-ip-address ``` * If you are using port forwarding, your command will be: ``` ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 ``` * Read and answer the questions and you will connect sucessfully. ## Setup private and public key authentication with or without password: * On the server, configure the firewall to accept ssh connections. ``` sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw enable sudo ufw status ``` * Now we need to generate an ssh key in our client computer. If you are using your ubuntu machine from the course, then you already have one. If you are not, then you must create the ssh keys: * In your client machine type: ``` ssh-keygen ``` * Now you can type this command to copy your ssh key to the server ``` ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub webmaster@server-ip-address ``` * if you are using port forwarding, use this command instead: ``` ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 2222 webmaster@127.0.0.1 ``` > if you use port forwarding your command will be: ``` ssh-copy-id -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1 ``` * Now you can connect to your server without having to remember the password.

    "content": "# {{page.title}} ## Description The goal of this project is to host a simple website (1-page site) in a web server. You will be installing Ubuntu Server in a virtual machine and managing the server from another computer. That computer can be your Host Machine (Windows) or the Ubuntu Desktop virtual machine that we use in the course. The project will give you basic/initial exposure to the following technologies: * Virtualization (VirtualBox) * Ubuntu Server * Apache * SSH * HTML * Markdown * VS Code The project is divided into 3 deliverables. It is done this way, so you can work slowly through the semester as you gain more knowledge working with Ubuntu Desktop. This also allows you to earn a grade as the semester progresses because the final grade is divided equally among the 3 deliverables. The final project is 20% of your final grade, however, this can change, therefore do not skip any deliverable! Each deliverable will be submitted as a Markdown document in your GitHub Repository. You will also be required to submit a PDF version of each deliverable, just in case something happens to your GitHub Repository. No late submission will be accepted. This project is due on Dec 21st. ## Requirements * A virtual machine/PC where you can install Ubuntu Server. A Virtual machine will be preferred since everything in the tutorials will be done in a virtual machine. This is the main tutorial we will follow: * [How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu 22.04](https://rapurl.live/ch3) Here are some sources you can use to investigate: * [What is a Web Server](https://rapurl.live/pbe) * [What is SSH](https://rapurl.live/9bg) * [What is Ubuntu Server](https://rapurl.live/57a) * [Open Source Web Servers](https://rapurl.live/pkm) ## Deliverable 1: Project's Requirements > **Old Video with more details is available [here](https://youtu.be/F0DdCC5Lq3A)** > **Newer and shorter video is available [here](https://youtu.be/CYasEYqKq-s)** > **[Image resize tool](https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/upload) > **Example of how the deliverable should look like [here](https://rapurl.live/5d8)** For **deliverable 1**, we are going to accomplish the following tasks: 1.

Now we need to create a virtual host file so that this new content can be served. The default configuration is located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/myresume.conf` 8. Add the following text to the domain config file: ``` ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName myresume ServerAlias www.myresume DocumentRoot /var/www/myresume ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ``` 9. Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. 10. Now enable the site with the following command: `sudo a2ensite myresume.conf` 11. Now lets disable the default domain:`sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf` 12. Before we can refresh the configuration, we need to add a configuration line to the `apache2.conf` file. Open the file in nano:`sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf` 13. Add the following line at the end of the file:`ServerName 127.0.0.1` 14. Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. 15. Now you can test the configuration for errors:`sudo apache2ctl configtest` 16. The output of the command should look like this: ``` Syntax OK ``` 17. If there are no errors, restart Apache to apply the changes:`sudo systemctl restart apache2` ![Setup Virtual Host 2](/assets/setup-virtual-host-2.gif) 18.

This will update the Ubuntu installer and proceed with the installation. ### Step 4 ![Step 4](/assets/step-4-keyboard-select.png) This step will automatically select the language layout of your keyboard. If for whatever reason it is different than what your physical keyboard has, then manually adjust it. ### Step 5 ![Step 5](/assets/Step-5-install-type.png) Choose the default Ubuntu Server installation. We will need some of the repositories in the default installation. ### Step 6 ![Step 6](/assets/step-6-ip-address.png) Since we are installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine that at the moment is configured to have a NAT network interface card, as long as your host PC has internet connection, you should automatically get an IP address. If you don't, something is wrong with your VM, Host Machine, or Internet Connection. > Note: If you are doing this project in the school's network, be aware that the school's routers are configured to block Bridged Ethernet adapters. ### Step 7 ![Step 7](/assets/step-7-proxy.png) Leave this part empty as we are not using a proxy. ### Step 8 ![step 8](/assets/step-8-mirror.png) We will use the default mirror so there is no need to change this ### Step 9 ![Step 9](/assets/step-9-disk.png) This step is to format our disk. Here we will select the entire disk. To move around here use either the arrow keys or the tab key. ### Step 10 ![Step 10](/assets/step-10-confirm-disk.png) ![Step 10.1](/assets/step-10-1-confirm-disk.png) This step is just to let you know the changes that will be made to the server's virtual hard drive. ### Step 11 ![Step 11](/assets/step-11-server-info.png) Here you will enter the information about your computer. Write this information down because you will needed it later. ### Step 12 ![Step 12](/assets/step-12-ssh.png) It is a good idea to install ssh now as we will use it later on. Do not import SSH keys. We will do that manually later. ### Step 13 ![Step 13](/assets/step-13-services.png) Do not select these services. We won't be using them. ### Step 14 ![Step 14](/assets/step-14-installation.png) This is the installation process. Once it is done it will start updating the system. Once the update is done, it will ask you to reboot. ### Step 15 ![Step 15](/assets/step-15-reboot-now.png) ### Step 16 ![Step 16](/assets/step-16-press-enter.png) Here Just press enter. Virtualbox will unmount the installation disk for you ## Part 3 Install Apache First, login to the server. You will need to type your username and password. Here is an example: ![log in](/assets/loging-in-ubuntu-server.gif) Notice that the password is hidden while typing just like when you are typing it in the terminal emulator. Be aware that during the upgrade, Ubuntu will ask you to restart some services. Apache is available in Ubuntu's default repositories. However, before we can start installing new packages, let's update the system: ``` sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y ``` ![Update Ubuntu](/assets/update-ubuntu-server.gif) To install Apache use: ``` sudo apt install apache2 -y ``` ![install apache](/assets/install-apache.gif) Be aware that here you will also need to restart some services here. ## Part 4 Setup SSH #### Before Setup Before we can setup SSH, we need to enable the firewall. Use this command: ``` sudo ufw enable ``` Now lets configure ufw to allow Apache and SSH traffic: ``` sudo ufw allow 'Apache' sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH' ``` Now check the status of the firewall: ``` sudo ufw status ``` ![firewall](/assets/firewallcheck.gif) Now lets check the status of Apache and SSH to make sure they are running: ``` systemctl status apache2 --no-pager systemctl status ssh --no-pager ``` Both commands should return `active (running)` if they do not, restart the services with the command: ``` sudo systemctl restart apache2 ssh ``` ![service status check](/assets/service-status-check.gif) #### Setup Port forwarding 1. Turn off the server virtual machine if it is on. 2. Go to the network virtual machine configuration for the server. There add port forwarding to the NAT configuration. You will need to forward port 22 to 2222 and port 80 t0 8080. Here is a screenshot: ![Port forwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) 3. Turn on the server. Make sure that the ssh server program is installed in the server virtual machine: ``` sudo apt install openssh-server -y ``` 4. Enable and start ssh in the server: ``` sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh ``` 5. Test the connection by logging in to the server from the client. In this case, your client is your Host computer terminal application (in Windows, it is the CMD or powershell) ``` ssh -p 2222 username_of_the_server@127.0.0.1 ``` 6. Read and answer the questions and you will connect sucessfully. ## Part 5 Setup virtual hosts Virtual host allows us to serve more than one website in a single web server. By default, Apache has one server block enabled. This server block is served from the directory: `/var/www/html`. For a single website, all the files are placed within this directory. When we setup virtual hosts, each site has its own directory. The recommendation is to leave the default `html` directory and for each site a new directory inside `/var/www`. In this project, we will have one virtual site called `myresume`. You are welcome to use a different name just remember to adjust every command where the word `myresume` is reference for your preferred website domain name. **Follow These Steps** 1. Create the directory for `myresume` as follows: `sudo mkdir /var/www/myresume` 2. Modify the ownership of `myresume` so that it is now owned by your user instead of root `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/myresume` 3. Now let's change the file permission so that the owner can read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others: `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/myresume` 4. Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called `index.html` in the `/var/www/myresume/` directory: `sudo nano /var/www/myresume/index.html`. 5. Once the new document opens, type the following text: ``` My Resume Website . ",

You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. > **NOTE:** > If you don't want to use Nano, you can also do this in a single command ``` sudo curl https://cis106.com/assets/basic.html -o /var/www/mywebsite/index.html ``` . ![setup virtual host 1](/assets/setup-virtual-host-1.gif) 7. Now we need to create a virtual host file so that this new content can be served. The default configuration is located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` However, we do not need to touch this file, we can instead create a new one as it is best practice. To create a new config file, we are going to use nano again: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/mywebsite.conf` 8. Add the following text to the domain config file: ``` ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName mywebsite ServerAlias www.mywebsite DocumentRoot /var/www/mywebsite ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ``` 9. Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. 10. Now enable the site with the following command: `sudo a2ensite mywebsite.conf` 11. Now lets disable the default domain:`sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf` 12. Before we can refresh the configuration, we need to add a configuration line to the `apache2.conf` file. Open the file in nano:`sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf` 13. Add the following line at the end of the file:`ServerName 127.0.0.1` 14. Save and close the file when you are finished. You can do this by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y` and `ENTER`. 15. Now you can test the configuration for errors:`sudo apache2ctl configtest` 16. The output of the command should look like this: ``` Syntax OK ``` 17. If there are no errors, restart Apache to apply the changes:`sudo systemctl restart apache2` ![Setup Virtual Host 2](/assets/setup-virtual-host-2.gif) 1.

Turn off the server virtual machine using this command: `sudo shutdown now` 2. Change the server network adapter configuration from NAT to Bridge. ![Network Adapter](/assets/networkadapter.png) >However, there is a chance that using a bridge adapter won't work for you. Some IDS (Instruction Detection Systems) and smart routers may prevent you from getting an Ip Address if your Network Adapter is bridge. In this case, you need to use [port forwarding](https://learn.g2.com/port-forwarding) in your virtual machine. Here is an example: ![portforwarding](/assets/portforwardingvirtualbox.png) ### Connect with SSH ![ssh connection](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTQha8cbvbsKtr6D7fqbP3CZ64F9sFTVqWpxEwvpJfg5VymCf5a6rutXUkzd3R3CTFSS9JXBt4BmOU-/pub?w=502&h=200) **Follow these steps:** 1. Make sure SSH is installed in both the client and the server: `sudo apt install openssh -y` 2. In the server, the SSH service must be already running, if it is not running, use this command to enable it and start it: `sudo systemctl enable ssh; sudo systemctl start ssh` 3. You will need to get the IP address of the server. Use this command to get the IP address: `hostname -I`. Additionally, you can setup a static IP address in your server. Here is a guide on how to do it. If you are doing this project in your laptop, I advise to stay away from setting up static IP addresses. 4. On the client computer use this command:![ssh syntax](https://rapurl.live/7ge) ![ssh connection](/assets/ssh-with-titles.gif) 5. If you are using port forwarding, your command would be:`ssh -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1` ### Setup private and public key authentication with or without password (optional) 1. On the server, configure the firewall to accept ssh connections. ``` sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw enable sudo ufw status ``` 2. Now we need to generate an ssh key in our client computer: In your client machine type:`ssh-keygen` Now you can type this command to copy your ssh key to the server:`ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub webmaster@server-ip-address` 3. if you use port forwarding your command will be:`ssh-copy-id -p 2222 username@127.0.0.1` 4. Now you can connect to your server without having to remember the password. ## Part 5 Setup virtual hosts Virtual host allows us to serve more than one website in a single web server. By default, Apache has one server block enabled. This server block is served from the directory: `/var/www/html`. For a single website, all the files are placed within this directory. When we setup virtual hosts, each site has its own directory. The recommendation is to leave the default `html` directory and for each site a new directory inside `/var/www`. In this project, we will have one virtual site called `mywebsite`.

Now lets create a simple html document to be served from our new virtual host. Create a document with the nano text editor called `index.html` in the `/var/www/mywebsite/` directory: `sudo nano /var/www/mywebsite/index.html`. 5.

Generate an ssh key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"` This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. When you're prompted to: `\"Enter a file in which to save the key,\"` press Enter. This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, to type a secure passphrase, press enter for no passphrase. If you want to use a passphrase, go ahead as it provides an extra layer of security. However, for this course you do not need to add a passphase. 2. Use the following command to see your public ssh key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` copy the entire output of this command to the clipboard. See examle here: 3. In your github page, go to `settings` > `SSH and GPG Keys` Here add your ssh key that you copied to the clipboad in the step prior. Type `yes` (the whole word) and press enter and you are done 4.

Every user has it's own home directory just like in a apartment complex they all residents have their own apartment while sharing the common areas. You have total ownership of your home directory but outside of the home directory only the root user can make changes. An example absolute path, assuming that user name is maria53, would be `/home/maria53` * **The home Directory:** This is the parent directory of all the home directories. This is where all the users' home directory are. The absolute path of this directory is `/home`. Noticed that it starts at the root. * **The root user:** This is the administrator account of your system. To perform administrative tasks or to manage directories and files outside of your home directory, you must obtain root privileges using the `sudo` command at the beginning of the command. * **Path name:** Also known as file path. This is the location of a given file in your computer. A path name can be absolute path or relative path. * **Absolute Path:** The location of a file starting at the root of the file system. For example, `/home/maria53/Downloads/list.txt` is the absolute path of the file `list.txt`. The advantage of absolute paths is that they can be used at any point of the file system regardless of your current directory. Any command that is given an absolute path will be able to find the file because it will start at the beginning of the filesystem. The disadvantage is that a command can be long to type if the file path is long. * **Relative Path:** The location of a file starting from a child directory of the current working directory or from the current directory itself. The advantage of using relative path is that typing commands is faster. The disadvantage of relative paths is that they cannot work from anywhere in the filesystem. In order for a relative path to work, a file must be reachable from the current directory onwards. Another disadvantage of relative paths is that they require a better mental understanding of the linux filesystem in the sense that you must keep a mental image of the directory tree that you are working with. An example of a relative path would be `Downloads/list.txt` assuming that the current working directory is `/home/maria53` ### Special characters: Special characters are function like commands that tell the shell to perform a specific action without having to type the complete command. These special characters make working on the command line more efficiently. Here is short list to keep in mind. * **. (single period):** represents the current directory. * **.. (2 consecutive periods):** represents the parent directory. * **~ (tilde character):** expands the current users home directory. It is like a variable that the shell uses to store the absolute path of the user's home directory. This `~/Downloads` is the same as typing `/home/maria53/Downlods` * **/ (one forward slash):** as mentioned earlier, this is the root directory and the shortest path in the system. This is the beginning of the directory tree. There is nothing before it and everything after it. * **- (hyphen-minus):** is used to move to the previous current working directory. * **# (hash or number sign):** This is used for single line comments in shell scripting. * **! (single exclamation mark):** used for repeating a command from the history. For example `!5` will repeat the 5th command in the command history. To view the entire command history type `history`. * **!! (2 consecutive exclamaton marks):** are used for repeating the previous command. For example, `!!` will repeat the previous command while, `sudo !!` will repeat the previous command but will add `sudo` at the beginning of the command. This is useful for times when we forget to type sudo when performing administrative tasks. ### Bash Environment Variables * **What is a variable?** * In programming, a variable is place to store data. A variable is like a box with a label. For example, if you a lot of pens in your desk and you place them in a box a label it pens, now the box store your pens. In programming a variable can be used to store temporary or permanent information that you will continuously reuse in your program. For example, `username='maria53'` the variable name now stores the value `maria`. When evener the programs need to access the maria's username, it can do it by referencing the variable `username`. * **What is an environment variable?** * Environment variables store values of a user's environment and can be used in commands in the shell. These values can be unique to the user's environment which makes them ideal when writhing commands that you want to use regales of which user is using the computer. To see a list of your environment variables type `env`. To use the value stored in an environment variable you must prepend the variable name with a `$`. Here are some useful environment variables: * **$USER** = stores the current's user username * **$HOME** = stores the absolute path of current's user home directory * **$PWD** = stores the absolute path of the present working directory. * **$OLDPWD** = stores the absolute path of the previous current working directory ### Bash Tips: * **Tab Completion**: autocomplete a command/pathname by pressing the tab key * **Arrow keys**: allows you to move, edit, and repeat commands * **Ctrl + a**: go to the start of the command line * **Ctrl + e**: go to the end of the command line * [Shortcut list](https://skorks.com/2009/09/bash-shortcuts-for-maximum-productivity/ ) . ## Commands to navigate the linux filesystem To navigate the linux filesystem, you only need to master 3 commands: `cd`, `pwd` and `ls`. While there are other useful commands, those can be considered complimentary and you should learn them after you have mastered those 3. ### PWD * **Usage** * Displays the absolute path of the current working directory. * **Formula** * `pwd` * **Examples** * Print the absolute path of current working directory * `pwd` . ### CD * **Usage** * Changes the current working directory. In other words, it moves you from one directory to another. By default, it will always send you to your home directory. * **Formula** * `cd` + `destination absolute path or relative path` * **Examples** * Go (change your current directory) to your home directory (there is more than 1 way of doing this): * `cd` (without any arguments, cd will take you home) * `cd ~` (using the ~ special character. as ~ will expand to the absolute path of the user's home directory) * `cd $HOME` (using the $HOME environment variable) * `cd /home/$USER/Downloads` (using $USER environment variable in the path) * Go to a specified directory with absolute path: * `cd /usr/share/themes` * Go to a specified directory with relative path assuming your current working directory is `/home` * `cd maria53/Downloads/` * Go to the previous working directory. This is useful when you are working with 2 directories located far in the directory tree * `cd -` * Go to the previous directory in the directory tree. One directory above. * `cd ../` * Go to 2 directories above the directory tree * `cd ../../` . ### Practice CD command: Try to complete these tasks without looking at the solution. Use the image below as a reference: . 1. Using absolute path, go to the directory \"`/user/share/themes/Adwaita`\" 2. Go back to your home directory. 3. Go back to the \"`/user/share/themes/Adwaita`\" using the - special character. 4. Go to the root of the filesystem using the \"`..`\" special character. 5. Go to your \"`Downloads`\" directory 1 directory at the time. Display/Print your present working directory once you have reached the \"`Downloads`\" directory. 6. Go back to your home directory and then to the \"`Pictures`\" directory. Show Solution . ### LS * **Usage** * ls is used for listing files and directories. By default it will list the current directory when no directory is specified. Listing means to see what is inside a directory. * **Formula** * `ls` + `option` + `directory to list` * **Examples** * See all the options of the ls command (extracted from the man page): * `ls --help` * List the current directory: * `ls` * List all the files including hidden files in current directory: * `ls -A` * List all the files inside a given directory: * `ls -A /usr/share/fonts/X11` (absolute path) * `ls -A Documents/` (relative path assuming that the $PWD is $HOME) * Long list a directory * `ls -lA ~/Pictures` * List a directory recursively * `ls -R Documents/` * Long list a directory only * `ls -ld Documents/` * List a directory sorted by last modified * `ls -t Documents/` * List a directory sorted by file size * `ls -S Documents/` * Long list a directory excluding group and owner information, with human readable file size and sorted in reverse order. * `ls -lhgGr Documents/` #### Output of LS -L explained: . ### Practice LS command: Try to complete these tasks without looking at the solution. 1. Use this command to download some example files: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ra559/cis106/main/assets/scripts/practice_ls.sh | bash` 2. The command above will create a directory in your home directory called `practicels` Here you will find 10 example files to practice ls. If the command above did not work, read the output carefully and try to fix it yourself. You can also download the zip file on your own. Read the basic script for the URL. 1. list all the files in the practice directory. 2. long list all the files in the practice directory. 3. long list all the files in the practice directory sorted by file size with human readable file sizes 4. long list all the files in the practice directory sorted by file size with human readable file sizes and in reverse order. 5. long list all the files in the practice directory without the group and owner, with human readable file sizes, sorted by file extension and with full time stamp. Show Solution . ### Tree * **Usage** * used to display a recursive directory listing (tree) of files. * **Formula** * `tree` + `option` + `directory` * **Examples** * Display a tree of the home directory * `tree ~` or `tree $HOME` or `tree /home/$USER` * Display a tree of a directory with file permissions * `tree -p ~/practicels` * Display a tree of a directory with the full path prefix, with the user and group owner, human readable file sizes, and the date of last modified. * `tree -pughD ~/practicels/` . ### EXA * **Usage** * Used the same way as ls. To list files and directories. Exa is a modern replacement for ls written in Rust. Exa is not installed by default. You will need to install it using your linux distribution package manager. * **Formula** * `exa` + `option` + `directory` * **Examples** * list all files in a given directory in a single line * `exa -1 ~/practicels` * long list all the files in a given directory * `exa -l ~/practicels` * long list all the files in a given directory with headers * `exa -lh ~/practicels` * list a directory in a tree like format * `exa -T ~/practicels` .
