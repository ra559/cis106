For Windows follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGmCwpFYi8). For macOS follow this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyx53lJyAoc) Once you have installed VirtualBox, create a virtual machine that meets these specifications: * OS: Ubuntu 20.04 64 Bits [ISO URL](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) * HDD: 50 GB * RAM: 2GB * Video: 64 MB or Higher * Audio Controller: Disabled (audio won't be needed) * CPU: 2 Cores * Add this to description: * **Hostname:** cis106vm * **User:** student * **Password:** pccc * Shared Clipboard: Enabled - Bidirectional ![Create VM](../imgs/createVM.gif) ## During Installation Settings Once you have created the virtual machine, turn it on and start the installation process. During the installation, make sure that you follow these specifications: * Keyboard layout: English US * Installation type: Normal with third party software, Erase disk * Timezone: NY * User Details * Name: Student * Hostname: cis106vm * Username: Student * Password: pccc * Require login (Important) ![Installation](../imgs/installation.gif) ## Post Installation Settings Once the operating system has been installed, make sure to take a snapshot of your machine. This is a good idea because if something goes wrong, you can revert back to the virtual machine state. Think of snapshots as a way of traveling back in time! * Update and upgrade * Remove unnecessary software * Essential software install * Disable animations * Change Default File Manager: Nemo * Change Default screenshot tool with flameshot * Enable Dark Theme You can do all of the above with a single command. * `sudo apt install curl -y; curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ra559/cis106/main/guides/oneliner.sh | bash` Install restricted extras, which is a package that contains other essential software that is normally not included by default because of copyright issues, being closed source or any other controversial reason. For instance, Microsoft core fonts are part of the restricted extras. * `sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons -y` ## Install Guest Additions This step is for VirtualBox only. Skip if using any other hypervisor. For instance, in VMware Workstation Player, these are installed via the command line without the need of a virtual disk. Guest Additions are a collection of software that gives the virtual machine more functionality and better performance. For instance, you having the Guest Additions installed allows you to use the full resolution of your monitor and to share the clipboard between your host and the guest OS. ![Guest additions](../imgs/install%20guest%20additions.gif) ## Change Desktop Environment The default desktop environment in Ubuntu 20.04 is Gnome 3. However, Gnome 3 is a heavy desktop environment not recommended for a low end machine with the specifications such as the one our virtual machine has. This is the reason why we will be using Gnome Classic which is a fork of the old Gnome 2 Desktop environment. Gnome Classic consumes considerably less system resources while remaining easy to use and functional enough. * Replace GDM with Lightdm: `sudo apt install lightdm -y` * Set default Desktop Environment to Gnome Flashback ![Gnome Classic](../imgs/setGnomeClassic.gif) ### VS Code setup VS Code is the text editor that we will use through out the semester to write our notes, labs, homeworks, and final project documentation. To make VS Code more functional, we will install a series of extensions. 1. Install VS Code Extensions: 1. Live Server 2. Markdown All in one 3. Markdown Preview Enhanced 4. Markdown PDF 5.

Create a file with the name of the website you want to launch in the directory: `/usr/share/applications/` with the `.desktop` extension 1. In my case I will create 3 files: `Slides, Docs, Sheets` 2. Use this command: `sudo touch /usr/share/applications/{Slides,Docs,Sheets}.desktop` 2. Inside each file, place the following lines of text: ### In Slides.desktop ``` [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Terminal=false Exec=/snap/bin/chromium 'https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/' Name=Slides Comment=Launcher for Google Slides Icon=/usr/share/icons/.customIcons/googleslides.png ``` ### In Docs.desktop ``` [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Terminal=false Exec=/snap/bin/chromium 'https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/' Name=Docs Comment=Launcher for Google Docs Icon=/usr/share/icons/.customIcons/googledocs.png ``` ### In Sheets.desktop ``` [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Terminal=false Exec=/snap/bin/chromium 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/' Name=Sheets Comment=Launcher for Google Docs Icon=/usr/share/icons/.customIcons/googlesheets.png ``` > **Notes:** > `Exec` is the command that will be launched when you click on the launcher. You need to use absolute path to call the commands. In my case, I have Chromium installed as snap package, therefore I will use the following command to run Chromium and open the designated website: `/snap/bin/chromium 'https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/'` if you want to know the absolute path of your web browser, use the `whereis` command followed by the web browser to see its full path. > `Icon` represents the absolute path of the icon file/img used by the launcher. I downloaded the icon of each file and placed it in a directory inside `/usr/share/icons` 3. Make the files executable. 1. In my case: `sudo chmod u+x /usr/share/applications/{Slides,Docs,Sheets}.desktop` ",

Extra (non-essential) customization](#11--extra-non-essential-customization) - [Extra](#extra) **Description:** This is a guide to make Ubuntu 20.10 more efficient so that it consumes less resources.The version of the Raspberry Pi used to complete this guide was: Raspberry Pi 400, 4 (2GB, 4GB, and 8GB). **No Overclock!** This guide is for those taking CIS-106 Linux Fundamentals and wish to use a Raspberry Pi over a Virtual Machine as their learning environment. There is a version of this guide using [Gnome classic](pi-ubuntu-gnome-classic.md) for those who want to use Gnome Classic over Gnome 3. ### 1. Update the system: Before installing any software, make sure the system is update with: `sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y;` ### 2. Install the necessary software: These are the applications that are not installed by default but that are needed for our day to day work on the pi. These applications are not essential, THIS IS AN OPINION! Ubuntu is ready to use out of the box! `sudo apt install gcc make perl nemo ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons git python3-pip flameshot pandoc vlc gnome-tweaks curl snapd flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak gnome-software-plugin-snap wget tree htop net-tools vlc peek vim deluge geany tilix neofetch midori -y` >**VS Code:** > >Download deb package from: *https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-arm64* >2. Run this command (assuming that you downloaded the file to your Downloads directory) >**`sudo apt install $HOME/Downloads/code*.deb`** ### 3. Remove non-essential software: The command below will remove some applications that I have no need for. This step is optional since you may find some use for these apps. However, you want to make sure that you remove irqbalance since it does not help the Raspberry Pi CPU. `sudo apt purge apport irqbalance aisleriot gnome-mahjongg gnome-sudoku gnome-mines thunderbird transmission-common -y` >**Explanation:** >* `apport`: package that does error reporting. >* `irqbalance`: It is useless in the Raspberry Pi. >* `aisleriot gnome-mahjongg gnome-sudoku gnome-mines`: office games. I dont play them so I dont need them. >* `thunderbird`: Mozilla email client that I do not use so I don't need. >* `transmission-common`: I do not use trasmission. I use deluge so I remove it. ### 4. Enable Gnome Extensions: The default Gnome 3 DE is too heavy for the Raspberry Pi. Thankfully there are extensions that we can use to remove/improve the performance of Gnome 3 on the Pi. * Go to: https://extensions.gnome.org/ click on `Click here to install Gnome Extensions`. Install the following extensions: 1. **Dash to panel:** will move the favorite bar to the bottom and turn it into a panel. 2. **caffeine:** will allow us to prevent the screen from locking. 3. **Blur my shell:** (Not essential!) It blurs the wallpaper when you open the activities menu. 4. **cpufeq by konkor:** will allow us to set a minimum frequency to all cores in the Pi 1. Increase the minimum frequency to 1Ghz 2. Disable splash screen ### 5. Disable Animations Animations make the system slower. Less effects = faster system. 1. Tweaks -> General -> Animations -> Off 2. Tweaks -> Suspend laptop lid -> Off (We are not using a laptop) ### 6. Turn off desktop icons I do not use desktop icons but if you do, keep this option on. 1. Extensions -> Desktop icons -> Off ### 7. Remove the frequently used program from gnome shell By default, Gnome 3 keeps the frequently used apps in the menu. This is not very useful to me but if it is useful to you, keep it! `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.privacy remember-app-usage false` ### 8. Tweak Dash to Panel There are a couple of things that we need to do to make our experience better. Open the extensions manager app and then open the settings of **Dash to Panel** 1. Under Position * Replace Applications Button with [Ubuntu logo](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/29985a98-ubuntu-logo32.png). this is not important, I just prefer the Ubuntu logo over the dots! 2.

During this lab, you will research some Linux distributions using a website called Distrowatch. DistroWatch is a website that provides news, popularity rankings, and other general information about various Linux distributions and other Unix-like operating systems such as OpenSolaris, MINIX and BSD. Go to [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/). Explore the website to get familiar with the home page. On the top left corner, you have a form that allows you to submit queries to the website. In the **“Type Distribution Name”** box type **“Ubuntu”.** This will return details about Ubuntu. Explore the Ubuntu Distrowatch page and answer the following questions: 1. What is the OS Type: * **Type your answer here** 2. Which major distro is it based on? * **Type your answer here** 3. Which processor architecture does it support? * **Type your answer here** 4. Is the distribution active or is it discontinued? * **Type your answer here** 5. What is the distro’s home page? * **Type your answer here** ### Question 2 On the top left corner, click on “Random Distribution” and answer the following questions from the distro you got. 1. What is the name of the distribution and the OS Type: * **Type your answer here** 2. Which major distro is it based on? * **Type your answer here** 3. Which processor architecture does it support? * **Type your answer here** 4. Is the distribution active or is it discontinued? * **Type your answer here** 5. What is the distro’s home page? * **Type your answer here** ### Question 3 On the top of the page, right in the middle, you will find an option that allows you to search for distributions. Click on **“Search”** and after the page loads, fill in the following information in the **“Search Distribution by Criteria”** section and Click on Submit Query. * OS Type: Linux * Architecture: x86_64 * Status: Active * Leave the rest as default. From the query results, choose any distribution and answer the following question about the distro you chose. 1. What is the name of the distribution? * **Type your answer here** 2. What is the country of Origin? * **Type your answer here** 3. What major distribution is it based on? * **Type your answer here** 4. What is the distribution category? * **Type your answer here** 5. Which processor architecture, aside from the one in the original query, does the OS support? * **Type your answer here** ### Question 4 Now that you know how to use Distrowatch. Find a Linux distribution for the following scenarios. For each distribution provide the website, name, and supported architecture. 1. A Linux distribution used for Data Rescue/Data recovery * Distro Name: **Type your answer here** * Website: **Type your answer here** * Desktop Environment: **Type your answer here** 2. A Linux distribution used for Education that supports the ix86 processor architecture. * Distro Name: **Type your answer here** * Website: **Type your answer here** * Desktop Environment: **Type your answer here** 3. A Linux distribution that supports the OEM installation method * Distro Name: **Type your answer here** * Website: **Type your answer here** * Desktop Environment: **Type your answer here** ### Question 5 (Extra credit 2 pts - Optional) On the Distrowatch homepage in the menu located in the middle of the page, you will find an option called **“Submit Distribution”.** This option lists all the Linux distros that are pending evaluation, on development or that are experiencing some sort of legal constraint. Select one of these distributions and in a paragraph, share your thoughts. (keep it simple 5 to 8 sentences). **Type your paragraph here** ## Working with DistroTest.net ### Question 6 DistroTest.net is a project that allows you to test Linux/BSD distributions on your web browser. This website is great for trying out distributions before you even download the ISO file. Go to [Distrotest.net](https://distrotest.net/) and click on any of the distributions. Start the distribution and take a screenshot of the browser window that just popped up. **Place Screenshot here** Locate the terminal application in the distribution you started and type the following command: `uname -a` Take a screenshot of the browser window showing the terminal application open. **Place Screenshot here** Stop the machine and take a screenshot of the browser window showing that the machine has been stopped. **Place Screenshot here** --- # What to submit? (Delete this section before submitting) * Submit the URL of this file in your Github repository. * Convert this markdown file as PDF and submit it in with the URL. * Each submission is worth 50 Points.

It will give you an idea of what we are trying to do here. IF you do not want to read the presentations, I went ahead and recorded videos for your convenience. The videos are very detailed and therefore they are a little long (30 to 40 minutes). Watch the videos if the presentation is not clear enough. Ask me questions if you have any. * Please go slow and take your time to do this lab. It is long but it is the core of this course. * For those who will be using the cloud environment only, you need to do this lab anyways since virtualization is part of the curriculum. * For those who do not have a computer powerful enough, you have a separate assignment to complete. ## WARNING! Only start this lab after you have watched the videos or read the presentations. ## Question 1 | Enable virtualization Before you can create virtual machines, you need to know if your computer can virtualize. There are a couple of steps you need to follow to find out the answer to this question: 1. For those using MacOS, if you have a recent Apple computer, chances are that you can virtualize with no problem. Once you have installed VirtualBox, make sure to install the Extension Pack and move along to question 2. For those using a Macbook with only 2 cores and 4GB of RAM, know that your computer will be very slow for this class and you may want to consider using an alternative. Contact me if this is your case. 2. For those using Windows, follow these steps: 1. Find out what hardware does your computer have: 1. CPU and number of cores 2. Amount of RAM 3. Amount of Free Storage 2. If your computer does not meet this criteria, stop this lab and get in contact with me. We may be able to find an alternative for you but this can only be done on a 1 on 1 basis. **RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS:** 1. CPU: Quad core CPU or Dual Core with base frequency of 2.0GHz 2. RAM: 6GB or More 3. Free Storage: 60GB or more 1. If your computer meets or exceeds the above capabilities, then you need to check if virtualization is enabled. Follow [this guide](https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003174386-How-to-enable-Virtualization-VT-on-Windows-10-for-BlueStacks-4) to know if your computer has virtualization enabled and if it does not, use the same guide to learn how to enable it. 2. You can also use Speccy to find out if your computer has virtualization enabled. 3. If you are having troubles enabling virtualization, let me know immediately. **DO NOT WAIT FOR THE LAST MINUTE!** This part can take time! > This questions does not require a submission. You can delete this question from your Lab if you want to since there is nothing to grade in this question. ## Question 2 | Create Virtual Machine Before you can create virtual machines, you need to install VirtualBox and VirtualBox Extension Pack. To download Vbox and the extension pack go to: * [Virtualbox Download Page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) Make sure to select the right installer for your operating system: ![VirtualBox Download page](../imgs/vboxdownloadpage.png) Make sure to install VirtualBox in your host computer. For Windows follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGmCwpFYi8). For macOS follow this [video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyx53lJyAoc) Once you have installed VirtualBox, create a virtual machine that meets these specifications: * OS: Ubuntu 20.04 64Bits [ISO URL](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) * HDD: 50 GB * RAM: 2GB * Video: 64 MB or Higher * Audio Controller: Disabled (audio won't be needed) * CPU: 2 Cores * Add this to description: * **Hostname:** cis106vm * **User:** student * **Password:** pccc * Shared Clipboard: Enabled - Bidirectional * Drag n' Drop: Enabled - Bidirectional ![Create VM](../imgs/createVM.gif) > Take a screenshot of your virtual machine settings. You screenshot must show all the settings of your VM. --- ## Question 3 | Install Ubuntu 20.04 Follow the [Ubuntu-vm-setup](../guides/Ubuntu-vm-setup.md) for installing Ubuntu 20.04 in your virtual machine. Make sure to go over the presentation \"Installing Ubuntu 20.04 in VirtualBox\" where I have laid out every step explained. I will do it in the video as well but it will benefit you more to read the presentation. > Take a screenshot of the last screen before rebooting Ubuntu. --- ## Question 4 | Prepare Ubuntu 20.04 Follow the [Ubuntu-vm-setup guide](../guides/Ubuntu-vm-setup.md) for a the post installation configuration. Once you have completed the installation of all the applications and have switched your desktop environment, take a screenshot of virtual machine. These are the tasks that you need to complete before taking the screenshots: * Update and upgrade * Remove unnecessary software * Essential software installation * Disable animations * Change Default File Manager: Nemo * Change Default screenshot tool with flameshot * Enable Dark Theme (optional) * Change the desktop environment --- ## Question 5 | Setup VS Code, Git and Github Vs Code was already installed in the previous question but the extensions have not been installed. Install all of these extensions: * Live Server * Markdown All in one * Markdown Preview Enhanced * Markdown PDF * Markdown TOC * PDF Preview * Markdown Converter * Code Spell Checker Once you have completed these steps, follow the guide: ['How to Setup Git and Github in Ubuntu 20.04'](../guides/Ubuntu%20Github%20Setup.md) to install and setup Git and Github in your virtual machine. This is the environment that we are going to use from this point on. Windows/MacOS will no longer be used for completing labs or any other assignment. > Take a screenshot of your virtual machine with VS Code running. > **ADVICE!** > Take a snapshot of your system. This will come handy in the case that you break your system. ## What will you Submit: * Create a markdown document with the following: ``` # Question 2 Screenshot ![](url to screenshot here) # Question 3 Screenshot ![](url to screenshot here) # Question 4 Screenshot ![](url to screenshot here) # Question 5 Screenshot Assignment description [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ra559/cis106/main/labs/lab2.md) ``` * Upload this document to Github and submit the URL in Blackboard.

Read the output of your search and find a GTK Theme (style theme, appearance) and an icon theme as well. Install the icon and gtk theme and then change your system's GTK and icon theme. ![Gnome Tweaks](../imgs/GnomeTweaks.gif) 1. Which command did you use to search for the themes and to install them? Use the command line to search for an alternative web browser (you already have chromium and firefox so look for something else). Install the alternative web browser. 2. Which commands did you use to find and install the web browser? 3. Use the command line to find a 3D or 2D racing game. Answer the following questions about the game: 1. **What is the name of the package?** 2. **What dependencies are needed in order to install the package? (you can either take a screenshot of the terminal or copy and paste from the terminal)** 3. **How much disk space will the package utilize after installation?** ## Question 2 | The pwd and cd command * **pwd**: Print the full filename of the current working directory. * **cd**: Change the shell working directory. ### Using pwd and cd with absolute path (remember to use the bash autocompletion feature) 1. Start a terminal. What is your present working directory? 2. Change your present working directory to `/usr/share/themes` 3. What is your present working directory? 4. Change your present working directory to the root of the filesystem 5. Change your present working directory to `/etc/firefox/pref` > **Take a screenshot of the terminal only. Your screenshot must show all the commands that you used to answer questions 1-5.** ### Using pwd and cd with a relative path (remember to use the bash autocompletion feature) 6. Clear your terminal window. Change the working directory to *YOUR* home directory. 7. Change the working directory to the Downloads directory. 8. Go back 2 directories. 9. Where are you now?. 10. Change the working directory to the Documents directory. > **Take a screenshot of the terminal only. Your screenshot must show all the commands that you used to answer questions 6-10.** ## Question 3 | The ls command * For this question we are going to use relative path only. * Clear your terminal. * Download 3 files from the internet (pictures, audio, document, or anything else). * Make sure that the files you downloaded are stored in your Downloads directory. * Mare sure that your working directory is your home directory. 1. List all the files in your Downloads directory. 2. List all the files in your Downloads directory including hidden files. 3. Long list all the files in your Downloads directory including hidden files. 4. Long list all the files in your Downloads directory including hidden files and human readable file sizes. 5. Long list all the files in your Downloads directory excluding hidden files, file owner and group, and including human readable file sizes. > **Take a screenshot of the terminal only. Your screenshot must show all the commands that you used to answer questions 1-5.** ## Question 4 | The tree command * For this question we are going to use Absolute path only. * Clear your terminal screen. 1. List all the files inside the `Downloads` directory. 2. List all the files inside the `Downloads` directory showing the permissions(protections), file owner, group owner, and human readable file size. 3. List all the files inside the `Downloads` directory showing the date of last modified and sorted by modification time. 4. List all the files inside the `Downloads` directory in HTML format 5. List all the files inside the `Downloads` directory in HTML format and save it to a file. > **Take a screenshot of the terminal only. Your screenshot must show all the commands that you used to answer questions 1-5.** ## Question 5 | Bringing it all together Utilities like `ls` are a bit old and many developers are starting to write replacements for these tools. One example, is the program `exa`. As per the project's website: > exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just one single binary. Unfortunately, exa is not available via the default reposorities in Ubuntu 20.04. However, this package is available for Ubuntu 20.10 and further releases. This however, does not mean that we cannot install the program. As you saw during the presentation, we can also install software using `.deb files.` To download the `.deb file` for `exa` use this command: * `wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/r/rust-exa/exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb` * To install the .deb file we can use apt: `sudo apt install ./exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb` * Once we have installed the package we do not need the `.deb file` so lets delete it with: `rm exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb` * Open a second terminal a use the command `exa --help` to see all the options of the exa command. Using these options as a reference, answer the following questions: 1. Long list all the files in your Downloads directory. 2. Long list all the files in your Downloads directory with a header and modified by timestamps. Another command that is also very useful is `tree`. This program allows you to list files in a tree like format which is very useful when you are working with multiple sub directories. 3. Install the tree program. Open another terminal and use the `tree --help` command to list all (or most) of the options of the tree command 4. Use `tree` to list all the files in your home directory including the file owner and group. 5. Use `tree` to list all the files in your home directory including their file size and in human readable format. > **Take a screenshot of the terminal only. Your screenshot must show all the commands that you used to answer questions 1,2,4 and 5.** ## What to submit? > **ADVICE!** > Take a snapshot of your system. This will come handy in the case that you break your system. ## What will you Submit: * Place all the screenshots and answers to your questions in a the lab3.md file.

The goal is to demonstrate how to use these commands successfully for administering a system. ![etc/passwd](https://rapurl.live/j37) ## Pre Work: * Create a directory called `Lab5` and change your current working directory to `Lab5`. You will complete the entire lab from this directory. * Before you start working on this lab, prepare your submission file and make an initial commit. * For examples of commands go to: [Linux Commands](https://robertalberto.com/linuxcommands/home.html) * For the presentation go [here](https://rapurl.live/nsd) ## Question 1 Cat, head and tail commands are used for displaying the content of a file. 1. Display the content of the `/etc/passwd` file. 2. Display the content of the `/etc/passwd` file in reverse order. 3. Display the content of the `/etc/passwd` file with line numbers and the $ to indicate the end of every line. 4. Display the first 5 lines of a the `/etc/passwd` file. 5. Display the last 5 lines of the `/etc/passwd` file. > Take a screenshot of **YOUR TERMINAL ONLY** showing all the commands that you used to complete this question ## Question 2 The cut command is very useful when working with files that are already formatted using a field separator. The cut command can show specific information about each line of text in a given file. 1. Display the first field of the `/etc/passwd` file. 2. Display the last 5 users in the `/etc/passwd` file. 3. Display a list of all the users and their designated login shell separated by an `=` sign. 4. The sort command is another amazing tool in any linux user’s tool box. Sort allows you to display data in a given order. Cut the first and 3rd field of the `/etc/passwd` field and sort the output. 5. Repeat the previous command but this time only show the last 5 entries. > Take a screenshot of **YOUR TERMINAL ONLY** showing all the commands that you used to complete this question ## Question 3 The wc command is used to count the number of lines, characters and words in a file. 1. How many lines does the `/etc/passwd` file have? 2. How many words does the `/etc/passwd` file have? Grep is the holy grail of command line tools. It allows us to search for specific strings inside a file. Here are some examples of the usage of grep: https://robertalberto.com/linuxcommands/commands/grep.html 3. How many users can login with the `/bin/bash` shell? 4. How many users have the `/sbin/nologin` shell assigned? 5. Display your user’s information in `/etc/passwd` file > Take a screenshot of **YOUR TERMINAL ONLY** showing all the commands that you used to complete this question ## Question 4 The ip command is used to manage network interfaces. To display the current NICs configuration, type: `ip ad` which is short for `ip address`. We are going to use the commands we learned to parse the output of the ip command. ![ip address cmd](../imgs/ipaddr.png) 1. Run the `ip ad` command and display all the lines that match the string `inet`. How many lines did you get? 2. Run the `ip ad` command and display all the lines that match the string `inet6`. Display the output in reverse order. 3. Run the `ip ad` command and display all the lines that match the string `inet` or `inet6` sort the output and save it to a file. 4. Run the `ip ad` command and display only the 3rd line that matches the string `inet`. 5. Run the `ip ad` command and display all the ipv4 addresses sorted. > Take a screenshot of **YOUR TERMINAL ONLY** showing all the commands that you used to complete this question ## Question 5 1. Run the following command and save the output to a markdown file: `echo \"# Information about my pc\"`. You can use any naming convention you want for the file as long as it is a markdown file. 3. Run the following command and append the output to the markdown file you created earlier: `echo \"## CPU Information\"` 2. The `lscpu` command displays a lot of information about the CPU the computer has. Use the `lscpu`, `grep`, and the pipe (|) to extract, and append to the file you created earlier, the following information from the output of the `lscpu` command: * Architecture * Threads * Cores * Model name * CPU Frequency * Virtualiation technology supported 3. Run the following command and append the output to the markdown file you created earlier: `echo \"## RAM Information\"` 4. The command `lshw -c memory` displays information about the RAM installed in your system. Extract and append to the file the following information: * Memory size: 5. Display the content of the file you created earlier showing all the data that has been appended so far. > Take a screenshot of **YOUR TERMINAL ONLY** showing all the commands that you used to complete this question ",

Once you learn VIM, you will hate every other text editor.~~~~ ## Question Do all the practices in the [vim presentation](https://rapurl.live/w4n) ## Question 2 1. Start vim. 2. In insert mode, enter the following text: ``` # What is Linux? (You need to write something here) # 3 Reasons to use Linux: * Reason 1 (You need to write something here) * Reason 2 (You need to write something here) * Reason 3 (You need to write something here) ``` 3. Save the file as **linux.md** 4. Quit vim. 5. Open the the **linux.md** file in vim. 6. Add the following text: ``` # Other operating systems * **Microsoft Windows** is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families, all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. * **macOS** is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. * **FreeBSD** is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), which was based on Research Unix. * **RISC OS** is a computer operating system originally designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England. ``` 7. Save the file as **linux+other.md** 8. Open the file **linux+other.md** and replace every instance of the word `Linux` with `GNU+Linux`. Save the file as `GNU+Linux.md`. 9. Open `GNU+Linux.md`, look for the logo of each operating system and insert the image bellow the description of the OS. Use a URL Shortener service like [Rebrandly](https://www.rebrandly.com/) to make the URL short if it happens to be a very long string. You must use Markdown syntax to add the image. 10. Display the content of all files and take a screenshot per file (you can use any of the commands you have learned so far). 11. Move the 3 files to your github repository. ## What will you submit? The URL of `lab6.md`. The `lab6.md` file must contain the following: * The 3 screenshots * The URL of each of the files: `linux.md`, `linux+other.md`, `GNU+linux.md`. ",

Since the FTP Server will be used to store files that are at least 2GB, it is recommended that you either select a big SD Card or attach an external storage to your Raspberry Pi via the USB port. In the case of this project, I will be using the SD Card. If you are setting this up for an environment where performance matters a lot, you should use a Raspberry Pi 4 and an SSD for storage. ## Software Specifications Raspberry Pi OS is the default operating system (Linux Distribution) for the Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi OS, previously known as Raspbian, is developed by the Raspberry Pi foundation and it is based on Debian. This means that this guide can be followed on any computer running Debian or Ubuntu. SSH or Secured Shell is a network protocol that allows us to create a secured connection between two computers. We will be using SSH to manage our Pi, install software, and setup a secure FTP server. SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol. Basically, FTP over SSH. ## Setup Operating System First, make sure to assemble the Raspberry Pi. This step will vary depending on the Pi kit that you buy but all kits come with instructions that you can follow. Once you have assembled the Raspberry Pi, connect the raspberry Pi to the monitor and connect the,keyboard and mouse. Do not connect the Raspberry Pi to the electricity since we have not setup the microSD card yet. Insert image here To install Raspberry Pi OS in the microSD card we are going to use a software called Raspberry Pi Imager which is provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. You can download the software from [here.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/). Once you have downloaded and installed the Raspberry Pi imager, start it. In Windows, make sure to run it as Administrator. If you are using Linux, you can start the application normally and you will be asked for your password before flashing the image into the SD Card. To flash Raspberry Pi OS follow these steps: 1. Select the operating system (Raspberry Pi OS (other) -> Raspberry Pi OS (Lite))2. Insert the micro SD card to your computer. 3. Select the micro SD card. 4. Click on write. Once the process is done, disconnect the sd card from your computer and insert it in the micro sd card slot in the Raspberry Pi. Now, you can connect the raspberry pi power supply. The Raspberry Pi will do its initial configuration and once it is done you will be presented with a CLI login prompt. Use the following credentials to log in: - Username: pi - Password: raspberry ### Connecting the Pi to the Network. If you are using ethernet, skip this part. Otherwise, follow these steps to connect your raspberry pi your wireless network: 1. Type: `sudo raspi-config` 2. Select option 1: System Options 3. Select option 1: Wireless Lan 4. Select your country 5. In the prompt `Please Enter SSID` enter the name of your wireless network (This is case sensitive) 6. Enter your wireless network password There are a couple of more things to do: - Change your password - Select \"System Options\" -> \"Password\" -> \"Enter new password\" - Change your hostname - Select \"System Options\" -> \"Set Hostname\" -> \"Enter hostname (I call mine sftpserver)\" - Enable SSH - Select \"Interface options\" -> \"SSH\" -> \"Yes\" - Update the system - Select \"Update\" - Finish and Reboot ### Connect to the Pi First you need to know the Raspberry Pi's Ip address. To find this information you can use several commands: * `hostname -I` * `ifconfig` * `ip addr` In your regular computer, you can use ssh to connect to the raspberry pi. Windows 10, Mac OS, and Most Linux distros come with an SSH client already installed. To connect to your Raspberry Pi use the following command: `ssh username@ip-address-of-your-pi` for example: `ssh pi@192.168.1.169` Once you run the command, a message similar to this will be prompted: ``` The authenticity of host '192.168.1.169 (192.168.1.169)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:BJlQmHyFwLGExcwkSvaasdasWty1BwSq2mxVVsumDqGc. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? ``` Make sure that you answer \"yes\". You will be asked for the password of the pi user and upon entering it you will be connected to your raspberry pi. Now you can disconnect the raspberry pi from the monitor and also the keyboard and mouse since we can control the Pi from any other computer even after a reboot. Setup SSH ## Install FTP Server Before installing sftp, update the system with: `sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y` this should go smoothly since you updated the pi earlier. To install sftp, run this command: `sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-sftp-server -y`. These packages should be installed already but if they are not they will be after running the installation command. ## Configure SFTP 1. First we need to create a user and a group for connecting to the ftp server. 1. To create a user use: `sudo adduser ftpu` where ftpu is the name of the user. When you get prompter for a password make sure to type one. The wizard will ask you for some basic information and it is optional to add it. 2. To create a group use: `sudo addgroup ftpg` where ftpg is the name of the group 3. ## Take FTP Server online Setup a DDNS Service for static Address Test FTP Server ## Challenges TBA ## Take this project further TBA ",

The application must meet the following requirements: * Must provide an input box for entering an integer value for the current glucose level. * Every entry must be saved to a database including the time stamp * Must provide a way to display a table of all the entries arranged by date and time ## Requirements The project requires the use of a LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, Mysql, and PHP). I am using the following specifications: * Linux Distribution: Ubuntu Server 20.04 * Web Server: Apache * DBMS: MariaDB (from the standard software repositories) * Php version: PHP 7 ## Setting Up The Server Environment ### Virtual Machine Specifications The virtual machine is built on HyperV in a Windows 10 Pro64 bit host. The host hardware specifications are: ![vm specs](../finalProject/imgs/vmspecs.png) The Virtual machine specifications are: * RAM: 2GB * CPU: 2 cores * Network adapter: 1 NIC in Bridge configuration to make development easy ### Configuring the server’s operating system After installing [Ubuntu Server](https://youtu.be/laQSC0KYWck) in the virtual machine, there are some configurations that need to be done before installing a web server and a database. It is essential to set up a firewall so that only connections to certain services are allowed. Additionally, SSH needs to be set up so that a remote connection to the server can be performed. For this project, I have enabled ssh to use keys for authentication instead of the default username and password functionality. #### Setting up UFW Ubuntu uses ufw (uncomplicated firewall) as the default firewall configuration tool for iptables. Ufw can block services by port, network interface, and IP addresses. The following commands are used to set it up: * To check the firewall status: `sudo ufw status` * To list all applications that have register their profiles with UFW: `sudo ufw app list` * To enable/disable/reload the firewall `sudo ufw enable|disable|reload` * To allow SSH connections `sudo ufw allow openssh` * To block an IP address `sudo ufw deny from 10.10.2.5` * To allow/deny connections from a given port ``sudo ufw allow|deny 21` * To allow/deny incoming HTTP requests `sudo ufw allow|deny http` * To allow/deny all incoming traffic from HTTP or https `sudo ufw allow|deny proto tcp from any to any port 80,443` For this project, It is necessary to make sure that the firewall is working and that at least for now ssh connections are permitted. To accomplish this use the following 1 liner: ` sudo ufw allow openssh; sudo ufw enable; sudo ufw status` ![Firewall check](../finalProject/imgs/firewallcheck.png) #### Setting up SSH Before setting up SSH keys, it is important to make sure that a connection with only the username and password can be made. In Windows, you can use [Putty](https://bit.ly/32UtZl4) which is a free SSH and Telnet client, or If your Windows 10 host computer is updated to the latest version, you should be able to use OpenSSH in Powershell or the [Windows terminal.](https://bit.ly/39rB4L0) To connect to the virtual machine, all is needed is the IP address of the machine and making sure that the server has a network interface card in bridge mode. In Hyper-V, you need to [create a virtual switch](https://rapurl.live/p8w) and then assign the virtual switch to the NIC of the VM. In the virtual switch management dialog box, the new switch needs to be set to External Network, and Allow management of the OS to share the network adapter needs to be checked. ![Hyper V Virtual Switch](../finalProject/imgs/hperv-vswitch.png) To obtain the IP address of the server using any of the following commands: * The hostname command will display all the IP addresses assigned to the host. `hostname -I` * The ifconfig and ip commands are used for configuring network interfaces. Ifconfig is deprecated as it is part of the net-tools package. Ip is the command that replaces the ifconfig command. If the examples below do not work for you, use the ifconfig command or ip command without the pipes, and examine the output carefully. * `ifconfig | grep “inet” | head -1` * `ip addr | grep “inet” | head - 3 | tail -1` To connect to the Ubuntu Server, in your Windows Terminal/Powershell type: `ssh your-username-in-the-server@ip-of-your-server` You will be asked to provide the user’s password and after successfully entering it, you will be connected to the server from your host computer. Because connecting to the server will be a repetitive task, I have set up SSH keys so that I do not have to type a password to connect. To create an SSH key, type the following command on the machine that will be connecting to the server: `ssh-keygen.exe` The command will generate an ssh-key and it will store it in a dedicated directory. Once the key is generated, we need to copy it to the Ubuntu Server. Use this command to achieve this task: `scp C:\\Users\\[username]\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub your-username-in-the-server@ip-of-your-server:/home/username` Once you have copied the SSH key, connect to the server one more time so that you can place the key in its appropriate directory. Use the following commands: 1. `ssh your-username-in-the-server@ip-of-your-server` 2. `cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys` ![SSH Setup 1](../finalProject/imgs/sshcopyid.png) ![SSH Setup 2](../finalProject/imgs/sshcopyid2.png) Now you should be able to connect to the server without the need of a password. ## Install The Software ### Apache Apache HTTP Server is an Open Source and Free Software web server software available in Linux, Windows, macOS, Solaris, and BSD. To install Apache on Ubuntu use the following command: `sudo apt install apache2` Once Apache has been installed, it needs to be enabled and restarted. Enabling a service in a Linux System means that such service/daemon will run on startup. To enable and restart Apache use the following command: `sudo systemctl enable apache2 && sudo systemctl restart apache2` In the command above the Systemctl program is used for managing Systemd which is Ubuntu’s init system and service manager. After enabling and restarting the Apache webserver service, it is required to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the webserver. Use the following command to allow these connections through the firewall: `sudo ufw allow in \"Apache\"` To check if your Apache Web server is running, open a web browser and type your server’s IP address in the URL bar. If your server is running, you should see the page below. If your server is not running, you can use the Systemctl useful commands and Apache log files to find the root cause of the problem. Keep in mind that the server must be in the same network as the client machine from where you attempted to visit the server’s IP. ![Apache works](../finalProject/imgs/apacheworks.png) #### Useful systemctl commands * To view active Systemd jobs: `systemctl list-jobs` * To view the default run level: `systemctl get-default` * To stop a running service: `systemctl stop service-name-here` * To start a service: `systemctl start service-name-here` * To restart a running service: `systemctl restart service-name-here` * To reload any service config’s file: `systemctl reload service-name-here` * To see the status of a service: `systemctl status service-name-here` * To enable a service on startup: `systemctl enable service-name-here` * To prevent a service from stating up at boot: `systemctl disable service-name-here` Apache saves logs files in the directory `/var/log/apache2`. The apache2 directory contains 2 files: `access.log` and `error.log`. The access.log file stores information about requests coming into the web server. The error.log file stores information about errors the web server encountered when processing requests. To review these log files, use the commands `cat`, `tac`, `head`, `tail`, and `grep`. You can find examples of these commands in my [website](https://bit.ly/2CZZks0). Another useful tool when troubleshooting issues with logs is the program `Journalctl`. Journalctl is used for querying and displaying logs from journald, systemd’s logging service. Without any argument, journalctl returns the full contents of the journal, starting with the oldest entry collected. Journalctl is efficient in outputting logs in multiple formats, for example, the following command will show Apache logs formatted in JSON: `journalctl -u apache2.service -r -o json-pretty` ![Journaltcl example](../finalProject/imgs/journalctl.png) ### MySQL To install MySQL in Ubuntu use the following command: `sudo apt install mysql-server`. After installing mysql-server, it is vital to run mysql_secure_installation to remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to the database. `sudo mysql_secure_installation` ![mysql secure installation](../finalProject/imgs/mysqlseqinstall.png) ### PHP PHP is an open-source general-purpose scripting language for the web. PHP was invented by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. In PHP, different from JavaScript, the code is executed on the web server and then the client receives the result of the execution in HTML. To install PHP in Ubuntu Server run the following command: `sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql` To test if PHP has been installed and it is running correctly, we can build a simple PHP page that will show the information about your PHP installation. First, make a backup of your index.html page then create a file called index.php and in it, type ``. ![PHP Installed](../finalProject/imgs/php.png) ### PHPMyAdmin Since PHP is a server-side programming language, it is useful when dealing with databases. However, managing databases via the command line can easily become a cumbersome chore. PHPMyAdmin is a web-based client that allows developers to manage databases with a simple to use interface. You can use phpMyAdmin to perform most administration tasks, such as creating a database, running queries, and adding user accounts. Before installing PHPMyAdmin, log in to your database, and check the password validation policy. The PHPMyAdmin installer will ask you for a password that matches the validation rules. Here is an example of how it looks: ![phpmyadmin installed](../finalProject/imgs/phpmyadmininstalled.png) To install PHPMyAdmin use the following command: `sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring` The PHPMyAdmin installer will ask you for several questions. Each prompt has a description of what is being asked therefore it is pivotal to read everything. Here are the questions and the answers I used: * **Web server to reconfigure automatically:** Apache (make sure to hit the space bar to select) * **Configure database for phpmyadmin with dbconfig-common?** Yes * **Connection method for MySQL database of phpmyadmin:** Unix Socket * **Authentication plugin for MySQL database:** Default * **MySQL database name for phpmyadmin:** it640project * **MySQL username for phpmyadmin:** robert@localhost * **Password:** Project640! > **Note:** if you encounter the error: 1819 (HY000) do not disable the validate_password plugin, instead, ignore the error and after PHPMyAdmin finishes installing, log into the database and run the create user command with a password that meets the policy. Here is an example:`CREATE USER 'robert'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Project640!'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` To test PHPMyAdmin, go to your web browser and type the username and password you created: ![phpmyadmin login page](../finalProject/imgs/phpmyadminloginpage.png) ## Project Code Once the system is configured and all the software is installed. I proceeded to write the base of the code. The first part is to write a basic HTML form where the user can enter the Glucose number and select the time and day. The HTML is then connected to a PHP script that sends the imputed data into the database. Once the data is in the database, the script runs another query to show all the values that have been entered so far. You can download a copy of the source code here: https://robertalberto.com/it640.tar ![HTML Part](../finalProject/imgs/htmlcode.png) ![CSS Part](../finalProject/imgs/css.png) ![PHP Part](../finalProject/imgs/phpcode.png) ![Code Demonstration](../finalProject/imgs/codedemonstration.png) ## Difficulties Encountered **MySQL Validate Password Plugin Issue:** During the installation of PHPMyAdmin, I came across a problem with the password validation plugin used by MySQL. Regardless of the password chosen, the phpmyadmin installer kept rejecting it. Online I found several solutions that involved uninstalling the plugin, changing the password policy, and creating another user that matches the policy exactly. None of these were viable solutions in my case. I solved this problem by first purging the PHPMyAdmin packages and dependencies, then I logged in to MySQL and created a user. In the installer, I chose to not ignore the problem and then log in to MySQL again and change the password of the newly created user. This user was then given full access to the database and I was able to continue with the project. **PHP Error 500 issue Server could not process request** While creating the PHP script I kept making syntax mistakes that were not obvious at the time. For instance, misspelling mysqli_connect, using double quotes in the _POST array and forgetting the $ at the beginning of the variable declaration. I decided to enable logging so that I can be aware of when I make these types of mistakes. This helped me out tremendously and I was able to get back on track quickly. ## Work Cited DigitalOcean. “UFW Essentials: Common Firewall Rules and Commands.” DigitalOcean, DigitalOcean, 18 Sept. 2019, www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands. “Log Files.” Log Files - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4, httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html “Systemd Cheat Sheet.” Linux Training Academy, www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/systemd-cheat-sheet/. “Using Journalctl - The Ultimate Guide To Logging.” Log Analysis | Log Monitoring by Loggly, 13 Aug. 2019, www.loggly.com/ultimate-guide/using-journalctl/. “What Is PHP?” Php, www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php.
