<p>This is a list of task that you will be required to complete every week.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete the designated lab <strong>(40 Minutes)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Each lab has a video walkthrough from beginning to end available in the course Youtube Channel.</li>
      <li>Each lab is a hands on activity consisting of 5 questions.</li>
      <li>I advise you to complete the labs in one sitting to avoid losing any data.</li>
      <li>Labs are the corner stone of this course and as a result are required to be completed in the designated order. You cannot do the next weekâ€™s lab if you do not complete the previous week lab as they build on each other.I</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Complete the assigned discussion board <strong>(30 Minutes)</strong>

          <li>Example of the commands/technoligies covered during the lecture</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The total study time is 2.16 hours. However, this is on average. Chances are that you may have to spend more time working on each task depending on how good you are with computers.</p>

<p>Do not leave this for the last minute. I will not grant you any extra time without a good reason and procrastination is not a good one. If leave the assignment for the last hour of the week and your computer breaks, that is your problem, I will not grant you any extra time.</p>

<p>I will not be taking late assignments. If you have not submitted your work, you get a zero.</p>
