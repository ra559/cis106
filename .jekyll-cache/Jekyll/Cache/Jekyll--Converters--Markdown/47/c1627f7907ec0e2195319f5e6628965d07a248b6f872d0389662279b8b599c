<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You do not need to be a pro using VIM if you do not plan to use it a a development environment. However, you do need 
to know the following things relatively well for your day to day work as a Linux User.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opening a file</li>
    <li>Saving a file and saving as another name</li>
    <li>Editing a file (working with vim multiple modes)</li>
    <li>Replacing text</li>
    <li>Vim search tools
Vim does a lot more than that, to a degree that a lot of Developers prefer to write code on VIM because its keyboard centric approach is a productivity enhancer. Once you learn VIM, you will hate every other text editor.~~~~</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GNU+Linux.md</code>, look for the logo of each operating system and insert the image bellow the description of the OS. Use a URL Shortener service like  <a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/">Rebrandly</a> to make the URL short if it happens to be a very long string. You must use Markdown syntax to add the image.</li>
  <li>Display the content of all files and take a screenshot per file (you can use any of the commands you have learned so far).</li>
