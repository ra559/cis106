<h2 id="question-1--installing-applications">Question 1 | Installing applications</h2>
<p>Using the command line, look for software packages that match the following search criteria: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">theme</code>. Read the output of your search and find a GTK Theme (style theme, appearance) and an icon theme as well. Install the icon and gtk theme and then change your system’s GTK and icon theme.</p>

<h2 id="question-5--bringing-it-all-together">Question 5 | Bringing it all together</h2>
<p>Utilities like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> are a bit old and many developers are starting to write replacements for these tools. One example, is the program <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exa</code>. As per the project’s website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>exa is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just one single binary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, exa is not available via the default reposorities in Ubuntu 20.04. However, this package is available for Ubuntu 20.10 and further releases. This however, does not mean that we cannot install the program. As you saw during the presentation, we can also install software using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.deb files.</code> To download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.deb file</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exa</code> use this command:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/r/rust-exa/exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb</code></li>
  <li>To install the .deb file we can use apt: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install ./exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb</code></li>
  <li>Once we have installed the package we do not need the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.deb file</code> so lets delete it with: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rm exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb</code></li>
  <li>Open a second terminal a use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exa --help</code> to see all the options of the exa command. Using these options as a reference, answer the following questions:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Long list all the files in your Downloads directory.</li>
  <li>Long list all the files in your Downloads directory with a header and modified by timestamps.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another command that is also very useful is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tree</code>. This program allows you to list files in a tree like format which is very useful when you are working with multiple sub directories.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the tree program. Open another terminal and use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tree --help</code> command to list all (or most) of the options of the tree command</li>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tree</code> to list all the files in your home directory including the file owner and group.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tree</code> to list all the files in your home directory including their file size and in human readable format.</li>
</ol>
