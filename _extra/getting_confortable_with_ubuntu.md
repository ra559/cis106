* 3- In your home directory, create a new directory called Games.
* 4- Inside the Games directory, create 3 more directories called: `fps`,`action`,`rpg`

<button class="btn btn-primary fs-5 mb-4 mb-md-0 mr-2" name="SolutionShow" 
    onclick="var x = document.getElementById('files-practice1');if (x.style.display === 'none') {x.style.display = 'block';} else {x.style.display = 'none';}">Show Solution</button>
<p align="center" style="display:none" id='files-practice1'><img src="/assets/extras/gcu/files-practice.gif"/></p>


### Part 2 - Working with tabs and files

* 1- Open the file manager if it is not open
* 2- Use Firefox or any other web browser of your choice to download the following this zip file: [https://cis106.com/assets/extras/gcu/site.zip](/assets/extras/gcu/site.zip)
* 3- Decompress/unzip the file in your Downloads directory.
* 4- Inside the Downloads directory you should now have a new directory called `site`
* 5- Inside the site directory you should have 3 files:
  * `site.html`
  * `SCRIPT.js`
  * `STYLES.css`
* 6- Use the website, [Pexex.com](https//pexels.com) to download 3 Landscape format images. 
* 7- Move the images to the `site` directory
* 8- Rename the images to: `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, and `image3.jpg`
* 9- Open the file `site.html`. Notice that the website looks broken. 
* 10- Rename the files SCRIPT.js and STYLES.css to:
  * `STYLES.css` => `styles.css`
  * `SCRIPT.js` => `script.js`
* 11- Refresh the website site.html and you will notice that now it looks as expected. This is because Linux is case sensitive. So STYLES.css is not the same as styles.css
