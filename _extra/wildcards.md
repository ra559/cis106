## Description

Wildcards or file globing is a shell feature that, using special characters, allows us to rapidly specify groups of filenames. Because we work with files all the time, it is useful to be able to work with multiple files at the same time. 

### Why and when should I use a wildcard?
Using wildcards can save you a lot of time. Imagine you need to move all the text files in a folder. You could move them one by oneâ€”if you know each file's name. But what if there are 300 files? Moving them one at a time would take forever! Wildcards help you by allowing you to match all files that meet a certain pattern or criteria, so you can move them all at once with a single command. Here are some examples:

* Copy all photos from a drive to a flash drive.
* Delete certain types of files from a folder.
* List all files that have a date in their name.

There are only 3 wildcards. Here is how they work:

| Wildcard | definition                            | example                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `*`      | matches 0 to any number of characters | `ls ~/Downloads/*.png`       |
| `?`      | matches 1 character                   | `ls ~/Downloads/f?ll.sh`     |
| `[]`     | matches 1 character from a set        | `ls ~/Downloads/f[0-9]ll.sh` |


## What does "matches x number of character" really mean?

This refers to the number of characters in the file name that can be matched everytime the wildcard is used in a command. For example, here is an illustration using the `*` wildcard:


<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/extras/star_wildcard_ilustration_1.png" style="display: inline-block; width: 45%;"/>
  <img src="/assets/extras/star_wildcard_ilustration_2.png" style="display: inline-block; width: 45%;"/>
</p>

Notice that because the `*` wildcard matches 0 characters and also any number of characters, this command: `ls *SC*.png` matches the files `Script_remover.sh` and `BackupScript.sh`.

To practice the wildcards, run this command:

```bash
curl https://cis106.com/assets/extras/wildcards.sh | bash
```

This will create a directory in your home directory called `wildcard_extra_practice`. This directory contains a bunch of files and directories (created at random). All the examples here will use the files in this directory.


## The * (star/asterisk) wildcard


### Examples:

* List all of the directories inside a given directory without listing their content
  * `ls -1d wildcard_extra_practice/*/`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/extras/wildcards/example_1_star.png">
</p>

* Move all the `.sh` (shell scripts) files
  * `mv wildcard_extra_practice/*.sh wildcard_extra_practice/scripts/`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/extras/wildcards/example_1_star_2.png">
</p>

* List and then move all the image files in the wildcard_extra_practice directory. You will need to create a directory first.
  * `mkdir wildcard_extra_practice/images/`
  * `ls wildcard_extra_practice/img-*.*` 
  * `mv -v wildcard_extra_practice/img-*.* wildcard_extra_practice/images/`

</p>

## The ? (question mark) wildcard

### Examples:

* List all the files that contain a 4 letter file extension.
  * `ls -1X wildcard_extra_practice/*.????` 
* List all the files that contain a 4 letter file extension and start with letter i:
  * `ls -1X wildcard_extra_practice/i*.????` 
* List all th files Microsoft Office 365 files.
  * `ls -1X wildcard_extra_practice/*.???x`

* List all the files that start with a capital letter
  * `ls wildcard_extra_practice/[A-Z]*`
* List all the files that contain a number in their name

### Note:
* Wildcards also have their limitations.
* For instance, "List all the files that do not contain a digit in the file name" You may assume that the approach would be `ls  *[!0-9]*`. However, this does not work. This wildcard translates to: <br> "***all files and directories in the current directory whose names contain at least one character that is not a digit (0-9)***" However, if you ever need this, here are two approaches:
  * Use ls + grep:
    * `ls *[!0-9]* | grep -v '[0-9]'`
  * Use find:
    * `find ./ -not -name '*[0-9]*' `
  * Find is preferred for scripts because ls is not suited for shell scripts. ls is intended to be a human friendly tool and the output is difficult to parse properly.

## Brace Expansion

Brace expansion is not a wildcard but a feature of the bash shell that allows you to create strings without needing loops. The strings can be filenames, sequences, or patterns. Brace expansion is handled before file globing and variable expansion. 

Brace expansion is used in the following manner:
* Open brace (`{`) + pattern separated by commas with no spaces + closing brace (`}`).

### Examples:
  * Create 3 html files
    * `touch {index,about,contact}.html`
  * Create 10 files numbered 1 to 10
    * `touch file{1..10}.txt`
  * Create a directory structure in a single command:
    * `mkdir -vp website/{assets,scripts,extras}`
  * Create an even more complex directory structure
    * `mkdir -vp website/{assets/{imgs,audio},scripts/{js,python},extras/{docs,helper}}`
  * Create files in increments using A to Z in the file name
    * `touch file{A..Z}.txt`
  * Remove the same 100 files created in the previous example:
    * `rm file{A..Z}.txt`

## Challenge Practice 1:

1. Inside the `wildcard_extra_practice` directory, create a new directory called: `Office365`.
2. Research a list of Microsoft Office 365 file extensions and use that knowledge to identify which files in the `wildcard_extra_practice` directory are Office 365 files. You should also research any file extension you do not recognized from the files in the `wildcard_extra_practice` directory.
3. Use a wildcard to move all the Office 365 files to the `wildcard_extra_practice/Office365` directory

<button class="btn btn-primary fs-5 mb-4 mb-md-0 mr-2" name="SolutionShow" onclick="var x = document.getElementById('ch_prac1');if (x.style.display === 'none') {x.style.display = 'block';} else {x.style.display = 'none';}">Show Solution</button>
<p align="center" style="display:none" id='ch_prac1'><img src="/assets/extras/wildcards/ch_prac1_solution.png"/></p>


## Challenge Practice 2:

1. Change your current working directory to `~/wildcard_extra_practice`
2. List and then remove all the files that contain 2 numbers in their file name right before the file extension. Be very careful with this step.
3. Create a new directory called `practice_docs`.
4. Move all the `html`, `odt`, and `pdf` files to `practice_docs`

<button class="btn btn-primary fs-5 mb-4 mb-md-0 mr-2" name="SolutionShow" onclick="var x = document.getElementById('ch_prac2');if (x.style.display === 'none') {x.style.display = 'block';} else {x.style.display = 'none';}">Show Solution</button>
<p align="center" style="display:none" id='ch_prac2'><img src="/assets/extras/wildcards/ch_prac2_solution.png"/></p>

## Challenge Practice 3:
1. List all the image files in the `~/wildcard_extra_practice` directory. Ignore the `images` subirectory. Only the images in `~/wildcard_extra_practice` must be listed.
2. Copy the images you listed in the previous step to the `images` subdirectory.
3. Inside the `images` subdirectory, create 1 directory for every file type.
4. Move each file type to its respective new subdirectory

<button class="btn btn-primary fs-5 mb-4 mb-md-0 mr-2" name="SolutionShow" onclick="var x = document.getElementById('ch_prac3');if (x.style.display === 'none') {x.style.display = 'block';} else {x.style.display = 'none';}">Show Solution</button>
<p align="center" style="display:none" id='ch_prac3'><img src="/assets/extras/wildcards/ch_prac3_solution.png"/></p>


## What will you submit for extra credit
1. In your cis106 directory/local repository, create a new directory called "ExtraCredit" (One word no spaces in file names pleases!)
2. Inside "`ExtraCredit`", create another directory called "`extra6`"
3. Open your cis106 directory/local repository in VS Code
4. Inside "`extra6`" create a markdown file called "`extra6.md`"
5. Add all the screenshots to "`extra6.md`" using proper markdown syntax and labeling each screenshot using heading 2 formatting. Save the markdown file.
6. Your markdown document should start with the following heading 1: `# Extra Credit 6: Wildcards`
7. Convert your file to PDF
8. Run the github commands, in VS Code Terminal, to push all your changes to github:
   1. `gid add .`
   2. `git commit -m "Completed Extra 5"`
   3. `git push`
9. In blackboard submit the following:
   1.  The URL of `extra6.md` 
   2.  The PDF file `extra6.pdf`
