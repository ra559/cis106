## Option 1
Simply create virtual machines of Windows or Ubuntu using Lab 2 as a guide. Keep in mind the following:
* The minimun hardware requirements and recommended requires of the OS.
  * For example here is for [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-system-requirements-6d4e9a79-66bf-7950-467c-795cf0386715)
* To optain an iso file for Windows, use the [Windows 10 Media creation tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d#ID0EJD=Windows_10) or [Windows 11 media creation tool.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d#ID0EJD=Windows_11)

For Ubuntu, try out the many Ubuntu Flavors in a virtual machine. You can use the live session or do the full installation

> Just remember to delete the virtual machine completely when you are done practicing
