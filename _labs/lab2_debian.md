## READ ME FIRST!

* This instructions are for Windows users (10/11) that are using **VirtualBox** as the **Hypervisor**
* **Because your computer is not my computer**, there can be issues that I have no way of accounting for. Other versions of this lab can be made upon request. I can also meet with you or work over zoom if you are having any issues. All I ask is that you are mindful of my time and yours. <br>**Do not wait till the last minute!!**

## Video Guide Here

> **Note:** If you are having too many issues with virtualbox, an alternative to use is VMware Workstation Player 17
> Here is a video on how to complete this lab using VMWare workstation player: <br>

## Presentations:
* [The basics of Virtualization](https://rapurl.live/est)
* [Using VirtualBox](https://rapurl.live/t0h)

## Requirements
* Please go over the presentations before you do this lab. It will give you an idea of what we are trying to do here. 
* Please go slow and take your time to do this lab. It is long but it is the core of this course. 
* If you do not have a computer that meets the recommended criteria, **please reach out to me and stop doing this lab.**

> **NOTE!**<br>
> * If your computer does not meet the required hardware, you will have a hard time completing all the work and the final project therefore be ready for some slow downs!


## Step 1: Enable Virtualization
Before you can create virtual machines, you need to know if your computer can run virtual machines. There are a couple of steps you need to follow to find out the answer to this question:

1. Find out what hardware your computer has:
   1. CPU and number of cores
   2. Amount of RAM
   3. Amount of Free Storage
2. If your computer does not meet the criteria below, stop this lab and get in contact with me. We may be able to find an alternative for you but this can only be done on a 1 on 1 basis.

#### REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS:
* **CPU**: Quad core CPU or higher 
* **RAM**: 8GB or More 
* **Free Storage**: 60GB or more

 > If you do not meet these requirements but your computer is close enough, you may be able to complete the course material. The downside is that your computer will be extremely slow therefore you will need to be smart about the applications you open.

If your computer meets or exceeds the above capabilities, then you need to check if virtualization is enabled. Follow [this guide](https://rapurl.live/vaj) to know if your computer has virtualization enabled and if it does not, use the same guide to learn how to enable it. You can also use [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) to find out if your computer has virtualization enabled.

> If you are having troubles enabling virtualization, let me know immediately. **DO NOT WAIT FOR THE LAST MINUTE!** This part can take time!


## Step 2: Install Virtualbox

In this course we will not be using the latest version of VirtualBox. Instead, we will use VirtualBox 7.0.26 because it is more stable than 7.1. The advantage of 7.1 is that it is faster than 7.0 but that speed comes at the cost of stability. If you are ok with occasional glitches, the go ahead and install 7.1. 

* Download the installer: [VirtualBox 7.0.26](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_7_0)
* Download the extension pack

* Download [Debian 12 ISO File](https://www.debian.org/). **DO NOT OPEN THE ISO FILE!**

### Steps to install VirtualBox

1. Double click on the installer: VirtualBox-7.0.26-168464-Win.exe and follow the prompts. Accept all the defaults.
2. Once the installer has finished, double click on the extension pack file installer: **Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-7.0.26.vbox-extpack** 
3. Close and reopen VirtualBox and move to the next step.

> Note: Do you need a visual guide for this step? Refer to the video.

## Special Note 1

## Special Note 2

## Special Note 3 (Final Exam)
* The final exam is in person. 
* The exam is performance based and will require access to a Linux Virtual Machine. 
* If you do not have a laptop/computer you can bring to school, <b style="color: red">a Linux Computer will be made available to you but you need to request it early because the amount of PCs is limited</b>
