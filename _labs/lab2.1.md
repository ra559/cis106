## Question 5 | Setup VS Code, Git and Github
Vs Code was already installed in the previous question but the extensions have not been installed. Install all of these extensions:
* Live Server
* Markdown All in one
* Markdown Preview Enhanced
* Markdown PDF
* Markdown TOC
* PDF Preview
* Markdown Converter
* Code Spell Checker

Once you have completed these steps, follow the guide: ['How to Setup Git and Github in Ubuntu 20.04'](../guides/Ubuntu%20Github%20Setup.md) to install and setup Git and Github in your virtual machine. This is the environment that we are going to use from this point on. Windows/MacOS will no longer be used for completing labs or any other assignment.

> Take a screenshot of your virtual machine with VS Code running.

> **ADVICE!**
> Take a snapshot of your system. This will come handy in the case that you break your system.
