# Lab 9 Shell scripting part 1

* Video [here](https://youtu.be/aJCx-X42Mko)

> **Special Note:** Try to do each script before you see the solution. This will allow you practice your critical thinking. If you complete the script in a way that gives you the same output as mine, submit your script instead of mine. Do not overthink it, if you feel like it is too much, simple continue with the video but try to understand the script before you continue with the next.

# Question 1
Create a script that long list a given absolute path. The output of the script should be as follows: <br>

For your convenience, the user input has been highlighted.
> Take as screenshot of your script and the output of your script after you run it.

# Question 2
Create a script that asks the user for their name and then checks if the user has an account in the computer.
The output of the script if the user has an account should be as follows:<br>

> Take as screenshot of your script and the output of your script after you run it.

# Question 3
Create a script that uses command substitution to create the following variables:
* The IP address of the machine
* Used amount of ram
* total amount of ram
* Size of the hard drive
* Available hard drive space
* total number of users that can login into the system
* hostname
The output of the script should look like this:<br>

 > Take as screenshot of your script and the output of your script after you run it.

# Question 4
Combine all the scripts into one. Use parameter variables to launch each script so that when the user runs the script with a given number as an argument, the right script runs. Here is a graphical description.<br>
