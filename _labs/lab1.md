3. Decompress the zip file inside your `lab1` folder
4. Open VS Code and open the lab1 folder

## Question 3
* Read the presentation ['What is Markdown'](http://bit.ly/2KJyqbV)
  > The goal of this lab is to learn and practice markdown. As we go over the presentation, we will be completing the next step.
* Create a new file called `what_is_ubuntu_submission.md` inside your `lab1` folder.
* Using markdown, replicate the document `whatisubuntu.pdf` that is located inside the `lab1` folder. Make sure to copy and paste the text. The goal of this lab is to practice markdown syntax not typing!
* Export the markdown file to PDF, and HTML

## Challenge Question
**Scenario:** Your friend, John Doe, has asked you to make a 1 page resume for him. He has given you all his information in a text file and a picture for you to use. Since you have recently learned about markdown, you want to write his resume in markdown and then give him the PDF.

* Using markdown, create a 1 page resume for John Doe. In the compressed file that you downloaded, you will find an image, resume.png, that has the result of how the document should look like after it has been converted to PDF. Once you have written the markdown file, convert the file to pdf and html. 

## Submission
In blackboard, submit the following:
* The markdown file of the resume and whatisubuntu.md
* The PDF file of the resume and whatisubuntu.md
* Upload all the files to your github repository and paste the URL of your github repository in the blackboard submission box (comment or text submission is fine).
