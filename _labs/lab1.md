## Question 3
* Read the presentation ['What is Markdown'](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT60qCF6P6dNMb8fhALPD6qQ8axSfnscCk0w0Znl1Yzos8CeXj2igO7biaJiOB3_U-jwOofEjD9bolZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
* The goal of this lab is to learn and practice markdown. Complete all the practice in the presentation and move the folder `markdownPractice` to the `lab1` folder when you finish the presentation.
* Please follow along in the video as I will be completing the practice there. 
* Once you complete the practice, do the challenge question



## Question 4: Challenge Question
**Scenario:** Your friend, John Doe, has asked you to make a 1 page resume for him. He has given you all his information in a text file and a picture for you to use. Since you have recently learned about markdown, you want to write his resume in markdown and then give him the PDF.

* Using markdown, create a 1 page resume for John Doe. 
* The Text file with john doe information can be found [here](/assets/lab1files/johndoeinfo.txt)
* The image of john doe can be found [here](/assets/lab1files/johndoe.jpeg)
* Once you have written the markdown file, convert the file to pdf and html. 
* [This](/assets/lab1files/resume.png) is how the PDF file should look like when you are done. PS. The Preview may not look like the finish product!

## What will you upload to Github:
1. All the files inside the lab1 folder including images, markdown files, pdf files, and html files.
2. All the files in the markdownPractice folder.
