üìÅ **Step 1: Enable File Extensions (Windows Only)**

1. If you're using Windows 10 or 11, make sure file extensions (like .md or .pdf) are visible. Some VS Code extensions will not work correctly if file extensions are hidden.
   1. [Windows 10: Enable file extensions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/common-file-name-extensions-in-windows-da4a4430-8e76-89c5-59f7-1cdbbc75cb01)
   2. [Windows 11: Enable file extensions](https://lazyadmin.nl/win-11/show-file-extension-windows-11/)
   3. macOS: No action needed - file extensions are shown by default.

üì¶ **Step 2: Set Up Your Practice Folder**

1. Download the file [lab1.zip.](https://cis106.com/assets/lab1/lab1.zip)
2. Unzip or decompress the file into your Documents folder.
3. You should now have a folder called lab1 in Documents.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do not just open the zip file. You must extract it first. If you're unsure how, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zl-Vl9iQo0).

üíª **Step 3: Open the Folder in VS Code**

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to File ‚Üí Open Folder... and open the lab1 folder.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always open a folder in VS Code when working - never just a single file.

üß© **Step 4: Install These VS Code Extensions**

1. Install the following extensions (search for them in the Extensions panel):
   1. [Markdown All in One ‚Äì by Yu Zhang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
   2. [Markdown PDF ‚Äì by yzane](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf)
   3. [Markdown Preview Enhanced ‚Äì by Yiyi Wang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
   4. [PDF Preview ‚Äì by Analytic Signal Limited](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=analytic-signal.preview-pdf)
   5. [Code Spell Checker ‚Äì by Street Side Software](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) (optional but recommended)

üîç **Step 5: Try the Extensions**

**1) Markdown PDF:**
   1. Open the file `Ubuntu.md` inside the `question1` folder.
   2. Right-click on an empty area and choose: **Markdown PDF: Export (PDF)**
   3. A file named `Ubuntu.pdf` should appear in the same folder.

**2) Markdown Preview Enhanced:**
1. Right-click on an empty area of `Ubuntu.md` and select: **Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview**
2. This lets you check for formatting issues before exporting.

**4) PDF Preview:**
1. Open the newly created `Ubuntu.pdf` file in VS Code.
2. It should open like a regular PDF viewer.

**3. Code Spell Checker:**
1. This extension highlights spelling mistakes in Markdown or code.

## Question 6 Working with Tables (10 pts)
### Instructions
* **Read Slides 32‚Äì34**

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Value A  | Value B  | Value C  |
```

> Make sure: Column headers are clearly labeled. The number of separators (`|`) matches the number of columns. Each row aligns properly under the correct column

**Step 3) Align Your Table for Readability**
1. While spacing between columns doesn't affect the preview, aligning them in the code improves readability.
2. You can use the VS Code extension "Markdown All in One" for automatic table formatting if installed.

**Step 4) Save and Preview**
1. Save your file.
2. Use Markdown Preview Enhanced to check that your table renders correctly.

## Question 7 Challenge Question ‚Äì Create a Markdown Resume (40 pts)

### Scenario
Your friend, John Doe, has asked you to create a 1-page resume for him. He has provided all of his information in a text file and included a profile picture.

Since you‚Äôve just learned Markdown, you decide to format the resume using Markdown and then export it as a PDF for John.

### What to Do

1. **Navigate to the question7 folder**. You will find:
   1. `info.txt` - John's resume content
   2. `resume.png` - a preview of the finished PDF
   3. `johndoe.jpeg` - john's profile picture

2. **Rename info.txt ‚Üí resume.md**
3. **Format the resume using Markdown**
   1. Use the Markdown skills you‚Äôve learned to format:
      1. Headings for sections (e.g., `## Education`)
      2. Bullet points for lists (e.g., skills, experiences)
      3. Bold and italic text where needed
      4. An image for John‚Äôs profile photo
   2. Use this reference image to guide your formatting:
      1. [VS Code Preview of resume.md](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRwXyXHaGDfXdZCAOKDecw733yT3hBNw5lguKA1yNzN0uCHvKByF1irB0iYVSqhHog54qO9KLP7Il93/pub?w=1440&h=1080)
4. **Preview your Markdown**
   1. Use Markdown Preview Enhanced to check how the resume looks in VS Code.
   2. Make sure everything fits on one page and is clearly organized.
5. **Convert to PDF**
   1. Right-click anywhere inside resume.md and select:
   2. Markdown PDF: Export (PDF)
   3. This will generate a resume.pdf file in the same folder.
6. **Compare with the Example**
   1. Open `resume.png` in the question7 folder.
   2. Your exported PDF should look similar to that example.
7. **Save Your Work. Double-check that:**
   1. `resume.md` is saved with all formatting
   2. `resume.pdf` is properly generated
   3. You didn't remove any content from the original `info.txt`
   4. John's profile photo renders in the markdown and the pdf

## Time to submit 

### Create a GITHUB account
1. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account using your PCCC email address. Make sure to save your github username, email, and password somewhere safe (like a password manager). You will need it a lot! If you already have a GitHub account, you are allowed to use it.
2. Create a public repository called cis106 LOWERCASE PLEASE!
3. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/uraJCa5V-Ao) on how to create a github account and repository.
4. Do not close the [GitHub](https://github.com/) page, you will need it later.

### What will you upload to Github:
The `lab1` folder. Every single file must be in your GitHub repository!

### Blackboard submission

In blackboard, submit the following:

* The PDF file `resume.pdf`. 
* The URL of your GitHub Repository. For example, here is mine:
[https://github.com/linuxworkshop67/cis106](https://github.com/linuxworkshop67/cis106)


### Here is how I will grade you:
* I will go to your github repository, I will check that you complete all the practice from the video that is 60 points.
* I will check that you completed the challenge question that is 40 points. Having the `resume.md` file properly formatted and the pdf file is proof of this.
* If I cannot find the files in Github, you will not be awarded a passing grade for this lab.

<p align="center" style="display:block"><img src="/assets/warning-icon.png" width="50" /></p>

### Regarding Late submissions
Late submissions will be penalized 20 points. See blackboard for due date


### Special Note Regarding the final exam:
* You will be required to use markdown during your final exam.
* The final exam is in person.
* The exam is performance based and will require access to a Linux Virtual Machine.
* If you do not have a laptop/computer you can bring to school, a Linux Computer will be made available to you.
