3. Read the presentation ['What is Markdown'](https://rapurl.live/va6)
* The goal of this lab is to learn and practice markdown. 
* Complete all the practice in the presentation and move the folder `markdownPractice` to the `lab1` folder when you finish the presentation.
* Please follow along in the video as I will be completing the practice there. 
* Once you complete the practice, do the challenge question


## Question 4: Challenge Question
**Scenario:** Your friend, John Doe, has asked you to make a 1 page resume for him. He has given you all his information in a text file and a picture for you to use. Since you have recently learned about markdown, you want to write his resume in markdown and then give him the PDF.

1. Using markdown, create a 1 page resume for John Doe. You should create the markdown file in the `lab1` folder. Name the markdown file `resume.md`
2. The Text file with john doe information can be found [here](/assets/lab1files/johndoeinfo.txt). You should download the file and place inside the `lab1` folder
3. The image of john doe can be found [here](/assets/lab1files/johndoe.jpeg)
4. Once you have written the markdown file, convert the file to pdf and html. 
5. [This](/assets/lab1files/resume.png) is how the PDF file should look like when you are done. PS. The Preview may not look like the finish product!
