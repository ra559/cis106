# {{page.title}}

## Question 1: VS CODE

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
2. If you find the VS Code interface complicated or too unfamiliar, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-s71n0dHUk) before you continue with the lab. 


## Question 2: Github Account

1. Create a [github](https://github.com/) account using your PCCC email address. Make sure to save this password. *You will need it a lot!* If you already have a github account, you are allowed to use it. 
2. Create a public repository called `cis106`  **LOWERCASE PLEASE!**
   1. Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/uraJCa5V-Ao) on how to create a github account and repository. 
3. Do not close the github page, you will need it later.
  
## Question 3: Learning Markdown
1. In your Documents folder, create a folder called `lab1` **LOWERCASE PLEASE!**
2. [Enable file extensions in Windows explorer.](https://rapurl.live/oy1)
3. Read the presentation ['What is Markdown'](https://rapurl.live/va6)
4. During this presentation you will complete several practice exercises. Make sure to place all the files inside the `lab1` folder.
5. You will need some exercise files that are reference in the presentation. Use this [URL](https://cis106.com/assets/lab1.zip) to download the zip file that contains the files. Uncompress the zip file in the `lab1` folder
6. Download the markdown cheat cheat before you start the challenge question.

* The goal of this lab is to learn and practice markdown. 
* Please follow along in the video as I will be completing the practice there. 
* Once you complete the practice, do the challenge question


## Question 4: Challenge Question
**Scenario:** Your friend, John Doe, has asked you to make a 1 page resume for him. He has given you all his information in a text file and a picture for you to use. Since you have recently learned about markdown, you want to write his resume in markdown and then give him the PDF.

1. Inside the lab1 folder, create a folder called: `challenegeQuestion` *One word, no space, camel case PLEASE!*
2. Using markdown, create a 1 page resume for John Doe. Name the file  `resume.md` and place it inside the `challengeQuestion`
3. Everything you need to create the markdown file was provided with the `lab1.zip` file you downloaded earlier.
4. Once the markdown file is created, convert the file to pdf.
5. [This](/assets/lab1files/resume.png) is how the PDF file should look like when you are done. PS. The Preview may not look like the finish product however the image and table must render correctly!

## Here is how I will grade you:
1. I will go to your github repository, I will check that you complete all the practice from the video that is 25 points. Having the ubuntu.md file complete is proof of this
2. I will check that you completed the challenge question that is 50 points. Having the resume.md file properly formatted is proof of this.
3. If I cannot find the files in Github, you will not be awarded a passing grade for this lab.
